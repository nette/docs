Integration and Plugins
***********************

Write templates in an editor or IDE that has support for Latte. It will be much more pleasant.

- NetBeans IDE has built-in support
- PhpStorm: install the Latte plugin in `Settings > Plugins > Marketplace`
- VS Code: search markerplace for "Nette Latte + Neon" plugin
- Sublime Text 3: in Package Control find and install `Nette` package and select Latte in `View > Syntax`
- to highlight code on the web use [Prism.js |https://prismjs.com/#supported-languages]
- in old editors use Smarty highlighting for .latte files

The plugin for PhpStorm is very advanced and can perfectly suggest PHP code. To work optimally, use [typed templates|type-system].

You can check for syntax errors in Latte templates using the `latte-lint` console command:

```shell
vendor/bin/latte-lint <path>
```
