Image Functions
***************

.[perex]
The [api:Nette\Image] class simplifies image manipulation, such as resizing, cropping, sharpening, drawing, or merging multiple images.

PHP has an extensive set of functions for manipulating images. But the API is not very nice. It wouldn't be a Nette Framework to come up with a sexy API.

Installation:

```shell
composer require nette/utils
```

Following examples assume the following class alias is defined:

```php
use Nette\Image;
```


Creating an Image
=================

We'll create a new TRUE color image, for example with dimensions of 100×200:

```php
$image = Image::fromBlank(100, 200);
```

Optionally, you can specify a background color (default is black):

```php
$image = Image::fromBlank(100, 200, Image::rgb(125, 0, 0));
```

Or we load the image from a file:

```php
$image = Image::fromFile('nette.jpg');
```

Need to detect the image format when loading? The method returns format in the second parameter:

```php
$image = Image::fromFile('nette.jpg', $type);
// $type is Image::JPEG, Image::PNG, Image::GIF
```


Save the Image
==============

The image can be saved to a file:

```php
$image->save('resampled.jpg');
```

We can specify the compression quality in the range 0..100 for JPEG (default 85) and WEBP (default 80) and 0..9 for PNG (default 9):

```php
$image->save('resampled.jpg', 80); // JPEG, quality 80%
```

If the format is not obvious from the file extension, you can specify it with one of the constants `Image::JPEG`, `Image::PNG`, `Image::GIF`:

```php
$image->save('resampled.tmp', NULL, Image::JPEG);
```

The image can be written to a variable instead of to disk:

```php
$data = $image->toString(Image::JPEG, 80); // JPEG, quality 80%
```

or send directly to the browser with the appropriate HTTP header `Content-Type`:

```php
// sends header Content-Type: image/png
$image->send(Image::PNG);
```


Image Resize
============

A common operation is to resize an image. The current dimensions are returned by methods `getWidth()` and `getHeight()`.

The method `resize()` is used for resizing. This is example of proportional size change so that it does not exceed 500×300 pixels (either the width will be exactly 500px or the height will be exactly 300px, one of dimensions is calculated to maintain the aspect ratio):

```php
$image->resize(500, 300);
```

It's possible to set only one dimension and the second one will be calculated:

```php
$image->resize(500, NULL); // width 500px, height auto

$image->resize(NULL, 300); // width auto, height 300px
```

Any dimension can be specified in percentages:

```php
$image->resize('75%', 300); // 75 % × 300px
```

The behavior of the `resize` function could be affected with following flags:

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Flag                   | Description
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| `Image::FIT` (default) | resulting dimensions will be less or equal as specified
| `Image::FILL`          | fills the target area and possibly extends it in one direction
| `Image::EXACT`         | fills the whole area and cuts what exceeds
| `Image::SHRINK_ONLY`   | just scales down (does not extend a small image)
| `Image::STRETCH`       | does not keep the aspect ratio


The flags are passed as the third argument of the function:

```php
$image->resize(500, 300, Image::STRETCH);
```

Flags can be combined:

```php
$image->resize(500, 300, Image::SHRINK_ONLY | Image::STRETCH);
```

Images can be flipped vertically or horizontally by specifying one of the dimensions (or both) as a negative number:

```php
$flipped = $image->resize(NULL, '-100%'); // flip vertical

$flipped = $image->resize('-100%', '-100%'); // rotate by 180°

$flipped = $image->resize(-125, 500); // resize & flip horizontal
```

After reducing the image we can improve it by sharpening:

```php
$image->sharpen();
```


Cropping
========

The method `crop()` is used for cropping:

```php
$image->crop($left, $top, $width, $height);
```

As with `resize()`, all values can be specified in percentages. The percentages for `$left` and `$top` are calculated from the remaining space, similar to the CSS property `background-position`:

```php
$image->crop('100%', '50%', '80%', '80%');
```


Drawing and Editing
===================

You can draw, you can write, you can use all PHP functions for working with images, such as [imagefilledellipse()|https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.imagefilledellipse.php], but using object style:

```php
$image->filledEllipse($cx, $cy, $width, $height, Image::rgb(255, 0, 0, 63));
```

See [#Overview of Methods].


Merge Multiple Images
=====================

You can easily place another image into the image:

```php
$logo = Image::fromFile('logo.png');
$blank = Image::fromBlank(320, 240, Image::rgb(52, 132, 210));

// coordinates can be set also in percentage
$blank->place($logo, '80%', '80%'); // near the right bottom corner
```

When pasting, the alpha channel is respected, in addition, we can influence the transparency of the inserted image (we will create a so-called watermark):

```php
$blank->place($image, '80%', '80%', 25); // transparency is 25 %
```

Such API is really a pleasure to use, isn't it?
