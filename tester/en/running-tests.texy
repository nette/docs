Running Tests
*************

Nette Tester is run from the command line. We can try it, without any arguments it will only show a help summary.

```shell
vendor/bin/tester            # installation by Composer in UNIX
vendor\bin\tester            # installation by Composer in Windows
php tester/src/tester.php    # manual installation
```

For simplification, we only use the **tester** command further in this document. But one of the ways mentioned above with a full path is required to run it.

As a parameter, we will pass the test directory. For the current directory just enter a dot:

```shell
tester .
```

The Tester walks through the passed directory and subdirectories. It creates a list of found tests and it runs them one by one. It runs every test as a new process, every test runs completely isolated from others.

.[tip]
The Tester searches for `*.phpt` and `*Test.php` files. The previously failing tests run as first.

.[warning]
The Tester runs PHP processes with **-n** option, so without **php.ini**. More details in the [#Own php.ini] chapter.



Command-line options
====================
We obtain command-line options overview by running the Tester without parameters or with option `-h`.

-p <path>
---------
The Tester uses this PHP binary for running the tests:

```shell
tester -p /home/user/php-7.2.0-beta/php-cgi tests
```


-c <path>
---------
The option is the same as for PHP binary. Passed **php.ini** is used for tests. No php.ini is used in default. Example when we distribute php.ini along with tests:

```shell
tester -c tests/php.ini tests
```


-C
---
A system-wide **php.ini** is used. So on UNIX platform, all the `/etc/php/{sapi}/conf.d/*.ini` files too.


''-l | --log <path>''
---------------------
Testing progress is written into file. All failed, skipped and also successful tests:

```shell
tester --log /var/log/tests.log tests
```


-d <key=value>
--------------
The option is the same as for PHP binary. It defines INI value for tests. The option can be used multiple times.


-s
---
Information about skipped tests will be shown.


--stop-on-fail
--------------
Tester stops testing upon the first failing test.


-j <num>
--------
Tests run in a **<num>** parallel precesses. Default value is 8. If we wish to run tests in series, we use value 1.


-o <console|tap|junit|none>
---------------------------
Output format. Default is the console format.

- `console`: the same as default, but the ASCII logo is not printed in this case
- `tap`: [TAP format |https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_Anything_Protocol] appropriate for machine processing
- `junit`: JUnit XML format, appropriate for machine processing too
- `none`: nothing is printed


''-w | --watch <path>''
-----------------------
The Tester doesn't end after tests are completed but it keeps running and watching given directory. It runs tests again whenever directory changes. Parameter can be used multiple times. It is handy during tests writing and debugging.


''-i | --info''
---------------
It shows information about a test running environment. For example:

```
tester -p /usr/bin/php7.1 -c tests/php.ini --info


PHP binary:
/usr/bin/php7.1

PHP version:
7.1.7-1+0~20170711133844.5+jessie~1.gbp5284f4 (cli)

Loaded php.ini files:
/var/www/dev/demo/tests/php.ini

PHP temporary directory:
/tmp

Loaded extensions:
Core, ctype, date, dom, ereg, fileinfo, filter, hash, ...
```


--setup <path>
--------------
The Tester loads given PHP script on start. Variable `Tester\Runner\Runner $runner` is available in it. Let's assume file `tests/runner-setup.php`:

```php
$runner->outputHandlers[] = new MyOutputHandler;
```

and we run the Tester:

```shell
tester --setup tests/runner-setup.php tests
```


--temp <path>
-------------
Sets a path to directory for temporary files of Tester. Default value is by `sys_get_temp_dir()`. When default value is not valid, you will be noticed.

If we are not sure which directory is used, we can run Tester with the `--info` parameter.


--colors 1|0
------------
The Tester detects a color-able terminal in default and colorizes its output. This option is over the autodetection. We can set coloring globally by a system environment variable `NETTE_TESTER_COLORS`.


--coverage <path>
-----------------
Tester will generate a report with overview how much is the source code coveraged by tests. This option requires PHP extension [Xdebug |https://xdebug.org/] or [PCOV |https://github.com/krakjoe/pcov] enabled, or PHP 7 with the PHPDBG SAPI, which is faster. The destination file extension determines the format of the content. HTML or Clover XML.

```shell
tester tests --coverage coverage.html  # HTML report
tester tests --coverage coverage.xml   # Clover XML report
```

Priority to choose collecting mechanism is following:
1) PCOV
2) PHPDBG
3) Xdebug

Extensive tests may fail during run by PHPDBG due to memory exhaustion. Coverage data collecting is memory consuming operation. In that case, calling the `Tester\CodeCoverage\Collector::flush()` inside a test may help. It will flush collected data into file and frees memory. When data collection is not in progress, or Xdebug is used, calling has no effect.

"An example of HTML report":https://files.nette.org/tester/coverage.html with code coverage.


--coverage-src <path>
---------------------
We use it with the option `--coverage` simultaneously. The `<path>` is a path to source code for which we generate the report. It can be used repeatedly.


Own php.ini
===========
The Tester runs PHP processes with **-n** option, so no **php.ini** is loaded (not even that from `/etc/php/conf.d/*.ini` in UNIX). It ensures the most clean environment for the tests run, but it also deactivates all the external PHP extensions commonly loaded by system PHP.

If you want to keep system configuration, use the `-C` parameter.

If you need some extensions or some special INI settings, we recommend to create own **php.ini** file and distribute it among the tests. Then we run Tester with **-c** option, e.g. `tester -c tests/php.ini`. The INI file may look like:

```ini
[PHP]

extension=php_pdo_mysql.dll
extension=php_pdo_pgsql.dll

memory_limit=512M
```

.[note]
Running the Tester with a system **php.ini** in UNIX, e.g. `tester -c /etc/php/cgi/php.ini`, does not load other INI from `/etc/php/conf.d/*.ini`. That's the PHP behavior, not the Tester's.
