Helpers
*******

DomQuery
--------
`Tester\DomQuery` is a class that extends `SimpleXMLElement` with methods that make it easier to test HTML or XML content.

```php
# let's have an HTML document in $html that we load
$dom = Tester\DomQuery::fromHtml($html);

# we can test the presence of elements using CSS selectors
Assert::true($dom->has('form#registration'));
Assert::true($dom->has('input[name="username"]'));
Assert::true($dom->has('input[type="submit"]'));

# or select elements as array of DomQuery
$elems = $dom->find('input[data-autocomplete]');
```


FileMock
--------
`Tester\FileMock` emulates files in memory to help you to test a code which uses functions like `fopen()`, `file_get_contents()` or `parse_ini_file()`. For example:

```php
# Tested class
class Logger
{
	private $logFile;

	public function __construct($logFile)
	{
		$this->logFile = $logFile;
	}

	public function log($message)
	{
		file_put_contents($this->logFile, $message . "\n", FILE_APPEND);
	}
}

# New empty file
$file = Tester\FileMock::create('');

$logger = new Logger($file);
$logger->log('Login');
$logger->log('Logout');

# Created content testing
Assert::same("Login\nLogout\n", file_get_contents($file));
```


Assert::with()
--------------
This is not an assertion, but a helper for testing private methods and property objects.

```php
class Entity
{
	private $enabled;
	...
}

$ent = new Entity;

Assert::with($ent, function () {
	Assert::true($this->enabled); // accessible private $ent->enabled
});
```


Environment::purge()
--------------------
The `purge()` method creates the specified directory and, if it already exists, deletes its entire contents. It is handy for temporary directory creation. For example in `tests/bootstrap.php`:

```php
@mkdir(__DIR__ . '/tmp');  # @ - directory may already exist

define('TEMP_DIR', __DIR__ . '/tmp/' . getmypid());
Tester\Environment::purge(TEMP_DIR);
```


Environment::lock()
-------------------
Tests run in parallel. Sometimes we need not to overlap the test running. Typically database tests need to prepare database content and they need nothing disturbs them during running time of the test. In these cases we use `Tester\Environment::lock($name, $dir)`:

```php
Tester\Environment::lock('database', __DIR__ . '/tmp');
```

The first argument is a lock name. The second one is a path to directory for saving the lock. The test which acquires the lock first runs. Other tests must wait till it is completed.


Environment::bypassFinals()
---------------------------
Classes or methods marked as `final` are hard to test. Calling the `Tester\Environment::bypassFinals()` in a test beginning causes that keywords `final` are removed during the code loading.

```php
require __DIR__ . '/bootstrap.php';

Tester\Environment::bypassFinals();

class MyClass extends NormallyFinalClass  # <-- NormallyFinalClass is not final anymore
{
	...
}
```


Environment::setup()
--------------------
- improves error dump readability (coloring included), otherwise, default PHP stack trace is printed
- enables check that assertions have been called in test, otherwise, tests without (e.g. forgotten) assertions pass too
- automatically starts code coverage collector when `--coverage` is used (described later)
- prints the status OK or FAILURE at the end of the script


Environment::RUNNER
-------------------
Lets you find out if the test was run directly or via the Tester.

```php
if (getenv(Tester\Environment::RUNNER)) {
	# run by Tester
} else {
	# another way
}
```


Environment::THREAD
-------------------
Tester runs tests in parallel in a given number of threads. We will find a thread number in an environmental variable when we are interested:

```php
echo "I'm running in a thread number " . getenv(Tester\Environment::THREAD).
```
