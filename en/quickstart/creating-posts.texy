Creating Posts
**************

What a great time. We have a super cool new blog, people are arguing in comments and we have finally some time for more programming. Though we like Adminer, it is not that comfortable to write blog posts in it. Perhaps the right time to add a simple form for adding new posts directly from our app? Let’s do it.

Let’s start by designing the UI:

1. On the homepage, let’s add link “New Blog Post”
2. It will show a form with title and textarea for content
3. When you click a Save button, it’ll save the blog post.

Later we’ll also add authentication and allow only logged-in users to add new posts. But let’s do that later. What code will we need to write to make it work?

1. Add the link to homepage template (`app/templates/Homepage/default.latte`)
2. Create a new page (template) which will show the form
3. Define the form for adding a new post
4. Define handler which will be executed when the form gets submitted, which will save the post.


Link for New Posts
===

You should already know how to add a new link to homepage. So try it yourself.

If you’re not sure, add this code somewhere to `app/templates/Homepage/default.latte`:

/---html
<a n:href="Post:create">Create New Post</a>
\---


Page for Creating a New Post
===

The link we just created points to `PostPresenter` and its action `create`. We can add a new method `renderCreate`, but actually it is not necessary. We don’t need to fetch any data from database and put it into the template, so the method would be empty. In such case, it doesn’t need to exist at all.

.[note]
If you want, you can have the empty method there; perhaps it’ll have some code later. It’s up to you.

Let’s just create the template (`app/templates/Post/create.latte`):

/---html
{block #content}

<a n:href="Homepage:">← back to posts list</a>

<h1>New post</h1>

{control postForm}
\--

All the could should be obvious by now. The last line tries to render the form which we are about to create.


Form for Saving Posts
===

Forms and components have been already covered when we were adding support for comments. If you're confused about the topic, go checkout [how forms and components work |comments#toc-form-for-commenting] again, we'll wait here ;)

Now add this method to the `PostPresenter`:

/---code php
	protected function createComponentPostForm()
	{
		$form = new Form;
		$form->addText('title', "Title")
			->setRequired();
		$form->addTextArea('content', "Content", 50, 20)
			->setRequired();

		$form->addSubmit("send", "Save and publish");
		$form->onSuccess[] = $this->postFormSucceeded;

		return $form;
	}
\---


Saving new Post from form
===

Continue by adding a handler method.

/---php
	public function postFormSucceeded(Form $form)
	{
		$values = $form->values;

		$post = $this->database->table('posts')->insert(array(
			'title' => $values->title,
			'content' => $values->content,
		));

		$this->flashMessage("Post was published", 'success');
		$this->redirect('default', $post->id);
	}
\---

Just a quick explanation, it fetches the values from form, inserts them into database, creates message for the user, that the post was saved successfully and redirects to page, where that post is published, so you can see, how it looks like.


Editing Posts
===

Let’s also add the capability to edit existing posts. It shall be pretty simple - we already have `PostForm` and we can use it for editing as well. We’ll add a new `edit` page and update the form handler, which will be able either to add new posts (as it does now), or to edit existing ones.

Add the method to the `PostPresenter`:

/---php
	public function actionEdit($postId)
	{
		if (!$post = $this->database->table('posts')->get($postId)) {
			$this->error('Post not found');
		}

		$this['postForm']->setDefaults($post->toArray());
	}
\---

Notice that the method is called `actionEdit` (and not `renderEdit`, as you may have expected). Render methods are for passing the data into template. Actions on the other hand may be doing a lot more, they should check if the page can be displayed by the current visitor or user and they should be doing most of the heavy work, that doesn't belong to form handlers. But, passing data into template would ofcourse also work in action methods, but it's suggested not to do it, because of separating responsibilities. Your code is simply more synoptic when you split the code into render and action method.

Now create a the template (`app/templates/Post/edit.latte`):

/---html
{block content}

<a n:href="Homepage:">← back to posts list</a>

<h1>Edit post</h1>

{control postForm}
\---

Let’s also extend the form handler:

/---code php
	public function postFormSucceeded(Form $form)
	{
		$values = $form->values;

		if ($this->postId) {
			if (!$post = $this->database->table('posts')->get($this->postId)) {
				$this->error("Post not found");
			}

			$post->update(array(
				'title' => $values->title,
				'content' => $values->content,
			));

		} else {
			$post = $this->database->table('posts')->insert(array(
				'title' => $values->title,
				'content' => $values->content,
			));
		}

		$this->flashMessage("Post was published", 'success');
		$this->redirect('default', $post->id);
	}
\---

When `$this->postId` parameter is provided, it means that a post is being edited. In such case we’ll check that the post really exists and if so, we’ll update it in the database. If the `$this->postId` is not provided, it means that a new post shall be added.

But where does the `$this->postId` come from? We didn't define it yet. In Nette Framework, there is a concept called "persistent parameters":http://doc.nette.org/en/presenters#toc-persistent-parameters, all you have know right now is, that when you have a value in persistent parameter, the generated urls on the same presenter (the form generates the url for it's action) will stay there - therefore persistent.

So add the persistent parameter, to the beggining of the `PostPresenter`

/--php
class PostPresenter extends BasePresenter
{
	/** @persistent */
	public $postId;

\--

Now, whenever there is a parameter in the url `/?postId=123`, the property `$this->postId` will have it's value and you can easily use it, as we did in form handler.


Summary
===

The blog is working, people are commenting rapidly and we no longer rely on Adminer for adding new posts. It is fully independent and even normal people can post there. But wait, that’s probably not ok, that anyone, I mean really anyone on the internet, can post on our blog. Some form of authentication is required, so that only logged-in users would be able to post. We'll add that in next chapter.
