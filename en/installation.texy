Downloading and Installation
****************************


Nette Framework installation is very simple: just [download|www:download] and unpack the Framework into a directory accessible from web server.

As you can see on the [Download|www:download] page, there is a PHP 5.3 version available, which uses the latest PHP features such as namespaces,
and also a version for older PHP 5.2. Choose the distribution according to the PHP version available on your server. Both variants are functionally 100% equal.

Unpack the archive to a folder such as '`nette`' in the root directory of your web server:

/--pre
<b>www/</b>                       ← root directory of your web server
└── <b>nette/</b>                 ← unpacked archive
    ├── <b>API-reference/</b>     ← offline version of <a href="http://api.nette.org">API reference</a>
    ├── <b>client-side/</b>       ← script for form validation
    ├── <b>examples/</b>          ← examples, directly executable
    ├── <b>Nette/</b>             ← framework itself
    │   ├── <b>Application/</b>
    │   ├── <b>Caching/</b>
    │   ├── <b>...</b>
    │   └── <b>loader.php</b>
    │
    ├── <b>Nette-minified/</b>    ← minified version of the framework
    │   └── <b>nette.min.php</b>
    │
    ├── <b>sandbox/</b>           ← prepared project
    │   ├── <b>app/</b>
    │   ├── <b>libs/</b>
    │   ├── <b>log/</b>
    │   ├── <b>temp/</b>
    │   └── <b>www/</b>
    │
    └── <b>tools/</b>             ← some useful tools
        ├── <a href="code-checker">Code-Checker/</a>
        ├── <a href="updating-2-0">Code-Migration/</a>  (only in PHP 5.3 distribution)
        ├── <b>Ini2Neon/</b>
        └── <a href="requirements">Requirements-Checker/</a>
\--

The entire framework is located in the `Nette` folder. There is a minified version available in the `Nette-minified` directory, containing only one file - `nette.min.php`.
It was created by merging all the files and removing all comments and whitespace. Both variants are functionally equal, the minified version is intended for production
use (easier to upload, higher speed).

There is a copy of [API reference|http://api.nette.org] available in the `API-reference` directory. In the `examples` directory, there is a set of simple, directly executable examples, the `tools` directory contains some useful tools and the `sandbox` is an empty prepared project - a starting point for [creating new application|presenters]. It is a functional project, so you can start experimenting with Nette immediately.


Running the application
-----------------

First, make sure your server [meets the minimum requirements|requirements] for running Nette Framework: run the Requirements-Checker:

/--
http://localhost/nette/tools/Requirements-Checker/checker.php
\--

[* requirements-checker.png *]

The green title "Congratulations! Server configuration meets the minimum requirements for Nette Framework." means everything is okay.

Now try to run `sandbox`:

/--
http://localhost/nette/sandbox/www/
\--

[* sandbox.png *]

It includes a bundled tool [Adminer|http://adminer.org/en/] for database management:

/--
http://localhost/nette/sandbox/www/adminer/
\--

Also, try some of the examples, such as:

/--
http://localhost/nette/examples/CD-collection/www/
http://localhost/nette/examples/Fifteen/www/
\--

[* cdcollection.png *]

If everything works, you can continue step by step to [create the first application|quickstart].
