DI: Services
************

Dependency injection (DI) container is easily configured using NEON files.

The configuration is usually written in NEON format. Have fun trying out the syntax at https://ne-on.org.


```neon
services:
	database: Nette\Database\Connection(%dsn%, %user%, %password%)

# or multi-lines
	database:
		factory: Nette\Database\Connection(%dsn%, %user%, %password%)

# or more multi-lines :-)
	database:
		class: Nette\Database\Connection
		arguments: [%dsn%, %user%, %password%]
```

Generates:

```php
function createServiceDatabase()
{
	return new Nette\Database\Connection(
		$this->parameters['dsn'],
		$this->parameters['user'],
		$this->parameters['password']
	);
}
```

Service definition:

```neon
services:
	database:
		class: Nette\Database\Connection
		factory: DbFactory::createConnection

```

`DbFactory::createConnection`:

```php
class DbFactory
{
	static function createConnection()
	{
		...
	}
}
```

Generates:

```php
	function createServiceDatabase()
	{
		return DbFactory::createConnection($this);
	}
```


Setup
=====

```neon
services:
	database:
		factory: Nette\Database\Connection(%dsn%, %user%, %password%)
		setup:
			- setCacheStorage(@cacheStorage)

```

Generates:

```php
	function createServiceDatabase()
	{
		$service = new Nette\Database\Connection(...);
		$service->setCacheStorage($this->cacheStorage);
		return $service;
	}
```

Autowiring feature adds dependencies automatically, so they don't even have to be mentioned:

```neon
setup:
	- setCacheStorage
```

In case the `cacheStorage` service does not exist, it is possible to use a result of a call as a parameter:

```neon
setup:
	- setCacheStorage( Factory::createStorage() )

# or a method of other service:
	- setCacheStorage( @factory::createStorage() )
```

Alternatively a newly created class instance:

```neon
setup:
	- setCacheStorage( Nette\Caching\Storages\FileStorage(%tempDir%) )

# generates: $service->setCacheStorage(new Nette\Caching\Storages\FileStorage(...));
```

You can also set a value of a property:

substitutions
```neon
setup:
	- $substitutions( [db: test] )

# generates: $service->substitutions = array('db' => 'test');
```

Full example:

```neon
parameters:
	database:
		driver: mysql
		host: localhost
		dbname: test
		user: jim
		password: beam
		substitutions:
			db: test

services:
	database:
		factory: Nette\Database\Connection(
			'%database.driver%:host=%database.host%;dbname=%database.dbname%',
			%database.user%, %database.password%, null,
			Nette\Database\Reflection\DiscoveredReflection()
		)
		setup:
			- setCacheStorage
			- $substitutions( %database.substitutions% )

```


Anonymous services
------------------

Time after time there are services that are in fact not referenced anywhere else in config files. Naming these services in this case is not necessary. To define an anonymous service, use the following syntax:

```neon
services:
	- Simple\Service

	-
		factory: Complex\Service
		setup:
			- setLang(%lang%)
```

To refer to such anonymous service you will need to use the fully qualified class name instead.

```neon
services:
	router: @App\RouterFactory::createRouter
```

Keep in mind that from a nature of anonymous services, it is not possible to register more than one of the same type, because it would lead to an ambiguity.


Service definitions inheritance
-------------------------------

```neon
services:
	dev_database < database
		setup:
			- Diagnostics\ConnectionPanel::initialize

```


Auto-wiring
===========

Auto-wiring feature can automatically pass dependencies into constructor and methods of the service. It uses typehinting and `@return` annotations. There can be only one service matching the type in the container, otherwise an exception is thrown.

To define more than one service of the same type we need to exclude them from auto-wiring:

```neon
services:
	cacheStorage:
		factory: Nette\Caching\Storages\FileStorage(%tempDir%)

	tempCacheStorage:
		factory: Nette\Caching\Storages\DevNullStorage
		autowired: no

```


When modifying the Nette Framework's core services we need to make sure the container is aware of the classes we want to use. That means using fully qualified class names in `@return` annotations or set the FQ class name with `class` entry.


Multiple configuration files
============================

Use `includes` section to add more configuration files.

```neon
includes:
	- parameters.php
	- services.neon
	- presenters.neon
```

Configuration merging process assigns the highest priority to the file containing `includes` section and the lowest priority to the first included file. To prevent merging of a certain array use exclamation mark right after the name of the array:

```neon
argument!: [1, 2, 3]
```
