Nette Configuration
*******************

.[perex]
An overview of all configuration options in the Nette Framework.

Nette application is easily configured using [configuration files |application/bootstrap#di-container-configuration]. They are usually written in [NEON format|neon/format]. We recommend to use [editors with support|best-practices/editors-and-tools#ide-editor] for this format for editing.

If you use a string that starts with `@` or has `%` anywhere in it, you need to escape it by adding another `@` or `%`. .[note]


Application
===========

Basic settings for [Nette Application |application/how-it-works].

```neon
application:
	# shows "Nette Application" panel in Tracy BlueScreen?
	debugger: ...           # (bool) defaults to true

	# will error-presenter be called on error?
	catchExceptions: ...    # (bool) defaults to true in production mode

	# name of error-presenter
	errorPresenter: Error   # (string) defaults to 'Nette:Error'

	# do bad links generate warnings?
	# has effect only in developer mode
	silentLinks: ...        # (bool) defaults to false
```

Because error-presenters are not called by default in development mode and the errors are displayed by Tracy, changing the value `catchExceptions` to `true` helps to verify that error-presenters works correct during development.

Option `silentLinks` determines how Nette behaves in developer mode when link generation fails (for example, because there is no presenter, etc). The default value `false` means that Nette triggers `E_USER_WARNING`. Setting to `true` suppresses this error message. In a production environment, `E_USER_WARNING` is always invoked. We can also influence this behavior by setting the presenter variable [$invalidLinkMode |application/creating-links#Invalid Links].


Mapping
-------

Defines the rules according to which the name of the class (for example `App\Presenters\HomepagePresenter`) is derived from the name of the presenter (for example `Homepage`). This the mapping can be achieved with the following configuration:

```neon
application:
	mapping:
		*: App\Presenters\*Presenter
```

The presenter name is replaced with an asterisk and the result is the class name. Easy!

If we divide presenters into modules, we can have our own mapping for each module:

```neon
application:
	mapping:
		Front: App\Modules\Front\*Presenter
		Admin: App\Modules\Admin\*Presenter
		Api: App\Api\*Presenter
```

Now presenter `Front:Homepage` maps to class ``App\Modules\Front\HomepagePresenter` and presenter `Admin:Dashboard` to class `App\AdminModule\DashboardPresenter`.

It will be more handy to create a general (asterisk) rule that will replace the first two rules and add an extra asterisk just for the module:

```neon
application:
	mapping:
		*: App\Modules\*\*Presenter
		Api: App\Api\*Presenter
```

Again, the presenter `Front:Homepage` maps to the class ``App\Modules\Front\HomepagePresenter`.

But what if we use nested modules and have a presenter `Admin:User:Edit`? In this case, the segment with an asterisk representing the module for each level is simply repeated and the result is class `App\Modules\Admin\User\EditPresenter`.

An alternative notation is to use an array consisting of three segments instead of a string:

```neon
application:
	mapping:
		*: [App\Modules, *, *Presenter]
```

This entry is equivalent to the original `App\Modules\*\*Presenter`.

The default value is `*: *Module\*Presenter`.


Automatic Registration of Presenters
------------------------------------

Nette automatically adds presenters as services to the DI container, which significantly speeds up their creation. How Nette finds out presenters can be configured:

```neon
application:
	# to look for presenters in Composer class map?
	scanComposer: ...      # (bool) defaults to true

	# a mask that must match the class and file name
	scanFilter: ...        # (string) defaults to '*Presenter'

	# in which directories to look for presenters?
	scanDirs:              # (string[]|false) defaults to '%appDir%'
		- %vendorDir%/mymodule
```

The directories listed in `scanDirs` do not override the default value `%appDir%`, but complement it, so `scanDirs` will contain both paths `%appDir%` and `%vendorDir%/mymodule`. If we want to overwrite the default directory, we use [exclamation mark |di/configuration#Merging]:

```neon
application:
	scanDirs!:
		- %vendorDir%/mymodule
```

Directory scanning can be turned off by setting false. We do not recommend completely suppressing the automatic addition of presenters, otherwise application performance will be reduced.


Constants
=========

Creating PHP constants.

```neon
constants:
	FOOBAR: 'baz'
```

The `FOOBAR` constant will created after startup.


Database
========

The configuration for one or more database connections for [Nette Database |database/@home].

```neon
database:
	# DSN, only mandatory key
	dsn: "sqlite:%appDir%/Model/demo.db"
	user: ...
	password: ...
```

It creates services of type `Nette\Database\Connection` and also `Nette\Database\Explorer` for the [Database Explorer|database/explorer] layer. The database connection is usually passed by autowiring, if this is not possible, use the service names `@database.default.connection` resp. `@database.default.context`.

Other settings:

```neon
database:
	# shows database panel in Tracy Bar?
	debugger: ...     # (bool) defaults to true

	# shows query EXPLAIN in Tracy Bar?
	explain: ...      # (bool) defaults to true

	# to enable autowiring for this connection?
	autowired: ...    # (bool) defaults to true for first connection

	# table conventions: discovered, static, or class name
	conventions: discovered  # (string) defaults to 'discovered'

	options:
		# to connect to the database only when needed?
		lazy: ...     # (bool) defaults to false

		# PHP database driver class
		driverClass:  # (string)

		# you can list the options found in the PDO driver documentation
		PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_COMPRESS: true

		# only MySQL: sets sql_mode
		sqlmode:      # (string)

		# only MySQL: sets SET NAMES
		charset:      # (string) defaults to 'utf8mb4' ('utf8' before v5.5.3)

		# only Oracle and SQLite: date format
		formatDateTime: # (string) defaults to 'U'
```

In the configuration we can define more database connections by dividing them into named sections:

```neon
database:
	main:
		dsn: 'mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test'
		user: root
		password: password

	another:
		dsn: 'sqlite::memory:'
```

Each defined connection creates services that includes section name in their name, ie `@database.main.connection` & `@database.main.context` and further `@database.another.connection` & `@database.another.context`.

Autowiring is enabled only for services from the first section. This can be changed with `autowired: false` or `autowired: true`. Non-autowired services are passed by name:

```neon
services:
	- UserFacade(@database.another.connection)
```


Forms
=====

You can change the default [form error messages|forms/validation] in the configuration.

```neon
forms:
	messages:
		EQUAL: 'Please enter %s.'
		NOT_EQUAL: 'This value should not be %s.'
		FILLED: 'This field is required.'
		BLANK: 'This field should be blank.'
		MIN_LENGTH: 'Please enter at least %d characters.'
		MAX_LENGTH: 'Please enter no more than %d characters.'
		LENGTH: 'Please enter a value between %d and %d characters long.'
		EMAIL: 'Please enter a valid email address.'
		URL: 'Please enter a valid URL.'
		INTEGER: 'Please enter a valid integer.'
		FLOAT: 'Please enter a valid number.'
		MIN: 'Please enter a value greater than or equal to %d.'
		MAX: 'Please enter a value less than or equal to %d.'
		RANGE: 'Please enter a value between %d and %d.'
		MAX_FILE_SIZE: 'The size of the uploaded file can be up to %d bytes.'
		MAX_POST_SIZE: 'The uploaded data exceeds the limit of %d bytes.'
		MIME_TYPE: 'The uploaded file is not in the expected format.'
		IMAGE: 'The uploaded file must be image in format JPEG, GIF, PNG or WebP.'
		Nette\Forms\Controls\SelectBox::VALID: 'Please select a valid option.'
		Nette\Forms\Controls\UploadControl::VALID: 'An error occurred during file upload.'
		Nette\Forms\Controls\CsrfProtection::PROTECTION: 'Your session has expired. Please return to the home page and try again.'
```


HTTP Headers
============

```neon
http:
	# headers that are sent with each request
	headers:
		X-Powered-By: MyCMS
		X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
		X-XSS-Protection: '1; mode=block'

	# affects header X-Frame-Options
	frames: ...      # (string|bool) defaults to 'SAMEORIGIN'
```

For security reasons, the framework sends a header `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, which says that a page can be displayed inside another page (in element `<iframe>`) only if it is on the same domain. This can be unwanted in certain situations (for example, if you are developing a Facebook application), so the behavior can be changed by setting `frames: http://allowed-host.com` or `frames: true`.

Headers `Content-Security-Policy` (hereinafter referred to as CSP) can be easily assembled, their description can be found in [CSP description |https://content-security-policy.com]. CSP directives (such as `script-src`) can be written either as strings according to specification or as arrays of values ​​for better readability. Then there is no need to write quotation marks around keywords such as `'self'`. Nette will also automatically generate a value of `nonce`, so `'nonce-y4PopTLM=='` will be send in the header.

```neon
http:
	# Content Security Policy
	csp:
		# string according to CSP specification
		default-src: "'self' https://example.com"

		# array of values
		script-src:
			- nonce
			- strict-dynamic
			- self
			- https://example.com

		# bool in the case of switches
		upgrade-insecure-requests: true
		block-all-mixed-content: false
```

Use `<script n:nonce>...</script>` in the templates and the nonce value will be filled in automatically. Making secure websites in Nette is really easy.

Similarly, headers `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` (which can be used in parallel with CSP) and [Feature Policy |https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/06/feature-policy] can be added:

```neon
http:
	# Content Security Policy Report-Only
	cspReportOnly:
		default-src: self
		report-uri: 'https://my-report-uri-endpoint'

	# Feature Policy
	featurePolicy:
		unsized-media: none
		geolocation:
			- self
			- https://example.com
```


HTTP cookie
-----------

You can change the default values of some parameters of the [Nette\Http\Response::setCookie() |http/request-response#setCookie] and session methods.

```neon
http:
	# cookie scope by path
	cookiePath: ...        # (string) defaults to '/'

	# which hosts are allowed to receive the cookie
	cookieDomain: 'example.com'  # (string|domain) defaults to unset

	# to send cookies only via HTTPS?
	cookieSecure: ...      # (bool|auto) defaults to auto

	# disables the sending of the cookie that Nette uses as protection against CSRF
	disableNetteCookie: ...  # (bool) defaults to false
```

The `cookieDomain` option determines which domains (origins) can accept cookies. If not specified, the cookie is accepted by the same (sub)domain as is set by it, *excluding* their subdomains. If `cookieDomain` is specified, then subdomains are also included. Therefore, specifying `cookieDomain` is less restrictive than omitting.

For example, if `cookieDomain: nette.org` is set, cookie is also available on all subdomains like `doc.nette.org`. This can also be achieved with the special value `domain`, ie `cookieDomain: domain`.

The default value of `cookieSecure` is `auto` which means that if the website is running on HTTPS, cookies will be sent with the `Secure` flag and will therefore only be available via HTTPS.


HTTP proxy
----------

If the site is running behind an HTTP proxy, enter its IP address in order to correctly detect the IP address of the client [Nette\Http\Response::getRemoteAddress()|http/request-response#getRemoteAddress] and encrypted connection [isSecured()|http/request-response#isSecured].

```neon
http:
	# IP address, range (ie. 127.0.0.1/8) or array of these values
	proxy: 127.0.0.1       # (string|string[]) defaults to none
```


Latte
=====

This setting globally affects the behavior of Latte in components and presenters.

```neon
latte:
	# shows Latte panel in the Tracy Bar for the main template (true) or for all components (all)?
	debugger: ...        # (true|false|'all') defaults to true

	# switches Latte to XHTML mode (deprecated)
	xhtml: ...           # (bool) defaults to false

	# generates templates with declare(strict_types=1)
	strictTypes: ...     # (bool) defaults to false

	# class of $this->template
	templateClass: App\MyTemplateClass # defaults to Nette\Bridges\ApplicationLatte\DefaultTemplate
```

It is also possible to register new tags either by entering the class name or by referring to the service. Method `install()` is called by default, but this can be changed by specifying the name of another method:

```neon
latte:
	# registration of user Latte tags
	macros:
		- App\MyLatteMacros::register         # static method, classname or callable
		- @App\MyLatteMacrosFactory           # service with install method
		- @App\MyLatteMacrosFactory::register # service with register method

services:
	- App\MyLatteMacrosFactory
```


Mail
====

By default, the mailer `Nette\Mail\SendmailMailer` is used to [send emails|mail/@home], which is not further configured. However, we can switch it to `Nette\Mail\SmtpMailer`:

```neon
mail:
	# use SmtpMailer
	smtp: true       # (bool) defaults to false

	host: ...        # (string)
	port: ...        # (int)
	username: ...    # (string)
	password: ...    # (string)
	timeout: ...     # (int)
	secure: ...      # (ssl|tls|null) defaults to null
	clientHost: ...  # (string) defaults to $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']
	persistent: ...  # (bool) defaults to false

	# context for connecting to the SMTP server, see stream_context_create()
	context:         # (array) defaults to stream_context_get_default()
```

To increase trustfulness, we can sign emails using [DKIM technology |https://blog.nette.org/en/sign-emails-with-dkim]:

```neon
mail:
	dkim:
		domain: myweb.com
		selector: lovenette
		privateKey: %appDir%/cert/dkim.priv
		passPhrase: ...
```


PHP
===

You can set PHP directives. An overview of all directives can be found at [php.net |https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php].

```neon
php:
	date.timezone: Europe/Prague
```


Routing
=======

Basic settings:

```neon
routing:
	# shows routing panel in Tracy Bar?
	debugger: ...   # (bool) defaults to true

	# to serialize router to DI container?
	cache: ...      # (bool) defaults to false
```

Router is usually defined in the RouterFactory class, a more limited alternative can be defined in the configuration using pairs `mask: action`:

```neon
routing:
	routes:
		'detail/<id>': Admin:Home:default
		'<presenter>/<action>': Front:Home:default
```


Access Control
==============

You can define a list of users in the configuration to create a [simple authenticator|security/authentication] (`Nette\Security\SimpleAuthenticator`). Because passwords are readable in the configuration, this solution is for testing purposes only.

```neon
security:
	# shows user panel in Tracy Bar?
	debugger: ...  # (bool) defaults to true

	users:
		# name: password
		johndoe: secret123

		# name, password, role and other data available in the identity
		janedoe:
			password: secret123
			roles: [admin]
			data: ...
```

You can also define roles and resources to create a basis for [authorizer|security/authorization] (`Nette\Security\Permission`):

```neon
security:
	roles:
		guest:
		registered: [guest]  # registered inherits from guest
		admin: [registered]  # and admin inherits from registered

	resources:
		article:
		comment: [article]   # resource inherits from article
		poll:
```


User Storage
------------

You can configure how to store information about the logged in user:

```neon
security:
	authentication:
		# after how long of inactivity the user will be logged out
		expiration: 30 minutes        # (string) default is not set

		# where to store information about the logged in user
		storage: session              # (session|cookie) default is session
```

If you choose `cookie` as your repository, you can also set the following options:

```neon
security:
	authentication:
		# jméno cookie
		cookieName: userId            # (string) výchozí je userid

		# which hosts are allowed to receive the cookie
		cookieDomain: 'example.com'  # (string|domain)

		# restrictions when accessing cross-origin request
		cookieSamesite: None          # (Strict|Lax|None) defaults to Lax
```


Session
=======

Basic [http/sessions] settings:

```neon
session:
	# shows session panel in Tracy Bar?
	debugger: ...        # (bool) defaults to false

	# inactivity time after which the session expires
	expiration: 14 days  # (string) defaults to '3 hours'

	# when to start the session?
	autoStart: ...       # (smart|always|never) defaults to 'smart'

	# handler, service that implements the SessionHandlerInterface interface
	handler: @handlerService
```

The `autoStart` option controls when to start the session. The value `always` means that the session is always started when the application starts. The `smart` value means that the session will be started when the application starts only if it already exists, or at the moment we want to read from or write to it. Finally, the value `never` disables the automatic start of the session. This has been in use since nette/http 3.1.3.

You can also set all PHP [session directives |https://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php] (in camelCase format) and also [readAndClose |https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-start.php#refsect1-function.session-start-parameters]. Example:

```neon
session:
	# 'session.name' written as 'name'
	name: MYID

	# 'session.save_path' written as 'savePath'
	savePath: "%tempDir%/sessions"
```


Session Cookie
--------------

The session cookie is sent with the same parameters as [other cookie|#HTTP cookie], but you can change these for it:

```neon
session:
	# which hosts are allowed to receive the cookie
	cookieDomain: 'example.com'   # (string|domain)

	# restrictions when accessing cross-origin request
	cookieSamesite: None          # (Strict|Lax|None) defaults to Lax
```

The `cookieSamesite` option affects whether the cookie is sent with [cross-origin requests |vulnerability-protection#SameSite cookie], which provides some protection against [Cross-Site Request Forgery|vulnerability-protection#cross-site-request-forgery-csrf] attecks.


Tracy Debugger
==============

You can set the [Tracy |tracy:] parameters in the configuration and also add new panels to the Tracy Bar. These settings are applied only after the DI container has been created, so errors that occurred earlier cannot reflect them.

Error logging configuration:

```neon
tracy:
	# if error has occurred the notification is sent to this email
	email: dev@example.com           # (string|string[]) defaults to unset

	# email sender
	fromEmail: robot@example.com     # (string) defaults to unset

	# period of postponement of emails sending (since Tracy 2.8.8)
	emailSnooze: ...                 # (string) defaults to '2 days'

	# to use a mailer defined in the configuration? (since Tracy 2.5)
	netteMailer: ...                 # (bool) defaults to true

	# for which error levels is BlueScreen also logged?
	logSeverity: [E_WARNING, E_NOTICE]  # defaults to []
```

Configuration for function `dump()`:

```neon
tracy:
	# maximum string length
	maxLength: 150             # (int) default according to Tracy

	# how deep will list
	maxDepth: 10               # (int) default according to Tracy

	# hide values of these keys (since Tracy 2.8)
	keysToHide: [password, pass]  # (string[]) defaults to []

	# visual theme (since Tracy 2.8)
	dumpTheme: dark                # (light|dark) defaults to 'light'

	# displays the location where dump() was called?
	showLocation: ...          # (bool) default according to Tracy
```

To install the Tracy extension:

```neon
tracy:
	# appends bars to Tracy Bar
	bar:
		- Nette\Bridges\DITracy\ContainerPanel
		- IncludePanel
		- XDebugHelper('myIdeKey')
		- MyPanel(@MyService)

	# append panels to BlueScreen
	blueScreen:
		- DoctrinePanel::renderException
```

Other options:

```neon
tracy:
	# in Development mode, you will see notice or error warnings as BlueScreen
	strictMode: ...           # defaults to true

	# displays silent (@) error messages
	scream: ...               # defaults to false

	# link format to open in the editor
	editor: ...               # (string) defaults to 'editor://open/?file=%file&line=%line'

	# path to template with custom page for error 500
	errorTemplate: ...        # (string) defaults to unset

	# shows Tracy Bar?
	showBar: ...              # (bool) defaults to true

	editorMapping:
		# original: new
		/var/www/html: /data/web
		/home/web: /srv/html
```

The values of the `logSeverity`, `strictMode` and `scream` options can be written as an array of error levels (e.g. `[E_WARNING, E_NOTICE]`) or as an expression used in PHP (e.g. `E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE`).
