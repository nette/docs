Nette DI Container
******************

.[perex]
Nette DI Container is one of the most interesting part of framework. It can generate compiled DI containers that are extremely fast and amazingly easy to configure.

Nette DI is a library that provides tools for generating and also automatically updating container classes. We instruct it (usually) using configuration files. The container we manually created in [previous section|container] would be written in the configuration [NEON|/neon/format] format as follows:

```neon
parameters:
	db:
		dsn: 'mysql:'
		user: root
		password: '***'

services:
	- Nette\Database\Connection(%db.dsn%, %db.user%, %db.password%)
	- ArticleFactory
	- UserController
```

The notation is really brief.

All dependencies declared in constructors of `ArticleFactory` and `UserController` are automatically detected and passed by Nette DI thanks to the so-called [autowiring|autowiring]. So you can concentrate on development.

If you want to pass dependencies using a setter, we can add a [setup|services#setup] section to the service definition.

Nette DI will actually generate the PHP code for the container. It is therefore extremely fast, the programmer knows exactly what he is doing and can even step it. A container can be tens of thousands of lines long for large applications, and maintaining something like this manually would probably not even be possible anymore.

Nette DI can also generate [factory|factory] code based on the interface. So instead of a class `ArticleFactory`, you would just need to create an interface:

```php
interface ArticleFactory
{
	function create(): Article;
}
```

You can find the full example [on GitHub|https://github.com/nette-examples/di-example-doc].


Using It Without a Framework
----------------------------

Utilization of Nette DI in an application is very easy. First we install it with Composer (because downloading zip files is so outdated):

```shell
composer require nette/di
```

We save the above configuration in a file `config.neon` and create a container using class `Nette\DI\ContainerLoader`:

```php
$loader = new Nette\DI\ContainerLoader(__DIR__ . '/temp');
$class = $loader->load(function($compiler) {
	$compiler->loadConfig(__DIR__ . '/config.neon');
});
$container = new $class;
```

and then let it create an object for example `Nette\Database\Connection`:

```php
$database = $container->getByType(Nette\Database\Connection::class);
$database->query('...');
```

But back to `ContainerLoader` for a moment. That notation is subject to one thing: speed. The container is generated once, its code is written to the cache (directory `__DIR__ . '/temp'`), and on subsequent requests it is only retrieved from there. Therefore, the configuration retrieval is placed in the closure in method `$loader->load()`.

During development, it is useful to enable auto-refresh mode, where the container is automatically re-generated if any class or configuration file is changed. Just provide `true` as the second argument in the constructor `ContainerLoader`.

As you can see, the use of Nette DI is definitely not limited to applications written in Nette, you can deploy it anywhere with just 3 lines of code.


Using It with the Nette Framework
---------------------------------

If you are developing applications in Nette, the configuration and creation of the container is handled by [Bootstrap|/application/bootstrap#toc-di-container-configuration].
