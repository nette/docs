Creating an Extension
*********************

.[perex]
So-called *extensions* can define their own tags, filters, functions, providers, etc. (see [how to extend Latte |extending-latte]), using a single reusable class.

So we create extensions when we want to reuse our Latte customizations in different projects or share them with others.
It is useful to create an extension for each of your web projects that will contain all the specific tags and filters you want to use in your project templates.
