<div class=perex>

Nette Framework extends PHP's object capabilities with a few syntactic candies. Do you like candy? Read and learn

- why you should use `Nette\Object`
- what is a *property*
- how to call events
- how to add methods to a class
- how to use @annotations

</div>

In this chapter we are focusing on `Nette\Object`, a class extending PHP's object model. It is the ancestor of almost all classes in Nette Framework. Being transparent and non-conflicting, it can be used as an ancestor for every class you make.


Installation:

```shell
composer require nette/utils
```


Strict Classes
==============

PHP gives huge freedom to developers, which makes it a perfect language for making mistakes. But you can stop this bad behavior and start writing applications without hardly discoverable mistakes. Do you wonder how? It's really simple -- you just need to have stricter rules.

Can you find an error in this example?

```php
class Circle
{
	public $radius = 0.0;

	public function getArea()
	{
		return $this->radius * $this->radius * M_PI;
	}
}

$circle = new Circle;
$circle->raduis = 10;
echo $circle->getArea(); // 10² * π ≈ 314
```

On the first look, it seems that code will print out 314; but it returns 0. How is this even possible? Accidentally, `$circle->radius` was mistyped to `raduis`. Just a small typo, which will give you a hard time correcting it because PHP does not say a thing when something is wrong. Not even a Warning or Notice error message. Because PHP does not think it is an error.

The mentioned mistake could be corrected immediately, if class `Circle` would be descendant of [api:Nette\Object]:

```php
class Circle extends Nette\Object
{
	...
```

Whereas the former code executed successfully (although it contained an error), the latter did not:

[* debugger-circle.webp *]

Class `Nette\Object` made `Circle` more strict and threw an exception when you tried to access an undeclared property. And Tracy displayed error message about it. Line of code with fatal typo is now highlighted and error message has meaningful description: *Cannot write to an undeclared property Circle::$raduis*. Programmer can now fix the mistake he might have otherwise missed and which could be a real pain to find later.

One of many remarkable abilities of `Nette\Object` is throwing exceptions when accessing undeclared members.

```php
$circle = new Circle;
echo $circle->undeclared; // throws Nette\MemberAccessException
$circle->undeclared = 1; // throws Nette\MemberAccessException
$circle->unknownMethod(); // throws Nette\MemberAccessException
```

But it has much more to offer!


Properties, Getters and Setters
===============================

*(For more experienced programmers)*

In modern object-oriented languages (eg C#, Python, Ruby, JavaScript), the term *property* refers to [special members|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_(programming)] of a classes, which look like variables but are represented by methods. When reading or assigning values to those "variables", methods are called instead (so-called getters and setters). It is a really useful feature, which allows us to control access to these variables. Using this we can validate inputs or postpone the computation of values of these variables to the time when it is actually accessed.

Any class that is a descendant of `Nette\Object` acquires the ability to imitate properties. Only thing you need to do is to keep simple convention:

- Getter and setter have to be *public* methods.
- Getter's name is `getXyz()` or `isXyz()`, setter's is `setXyz()`
- Getter and setter are optional, so it is possible to have *read-only* or *write-only* properties
- Names of properties are case-sensitive (first letter being an exception)

We will make use of properties in the class Circle to make sure the variable `$radius` contains only non-negative numbers. We will replace `public $ radius` with the property:

```php
class Circle extends Nette\Object
{
	private $radius; // not public anymore!

	// getter for property $radius
	public function getRadius()
	{
		return $this->radius;
	}

	// setter for property $radius
	public function setRadius($radius)
	{
		// sanitizing value before saving it
		$this->radius = max(0.0, (float) $radius);
	}

	// getter for property $visible
	public function isVisible()
	{
		return $this->radius > 0;
	}
}

$circle = new Circle;
// the classic way using method calls
$circle->setRadius(10); // sets circle's radius
echo $circle->isVisible();

// the alternative way using properties
$circle->radius = 10;  // calls setRadius(10)
echo $circle->radius;  // calls getRadius()
echo $circle->visible; // calls isVisible()
```

Properties are mostly a syntactic sugar to beautify the code and make programmer's life easier. You do not have to use them, if you don't want to.


Events
======

*(For more experienced programmers)*

Now we are going to create functions, which will be called when radius changes. Let's call it `change` event and those functions event handlers:

```php
class Circle extends Nette\Object
{
	/** @var array */
	public $onChange;

	public function setRadius($radius)
	{
		// it calls callbacks in $onChange with parameters $this, $radius
		$this->onChange($this, $radius);

		$this->radius = max(0.0, (float) $radius);
	}
}

$circle = new Circle;

// adding an event handler
$circle->onChange[] = function (Circle $circle, $newValue) {
	echo 'there was a change!';
};

$circle->setRadius(10);
```

There is another syntactic sugar in `setRadius`'s code. Instead of iteration on `$onChange` array and calling each method one by one with unreliable (does not report if callback has any errors) function [php:call_user_func], you just have to write simple `onChange(...)` and given parameters will be handed over to the handlers.


Extension Methods
=================

Do you need to add a new method to an existing object or class at runtime? **Extension methods** is just what you need.

```php
// declaration of future method Circle::getCircumference()
Circle::extensionMethod('getCircumference', function (Circle $that) {
	return $that->radius * 2 * M_PI;
});

$circle = new Circle;
$circle->radius = 10;
echo $circle->getCircumference(); // ≈ 62.8
```


Extensions methods can also take parameters. They don't break encapsulation, because they only have access to the public members of the class. You can also connect them with interfaces, therefore every class implementing that interface will have that method available.


Reflection
==========

If you need to find every information about any class, reflection is the right tool to do it. You can easily find out which methods does any class have, what parameters do those methods accept, etc. `Nette\Object` simplifies access to class' self-reflection with method `getReflection()`, returning a [ClassType |api:Nette\Reflection\ClassType]) object:


```php
$circle = new Circle;
echo $circle->getReflection()->hasMethod('getArea'); // does method 'test' exist?
echo $circle->getReflection()->getName(); // returns the name of the class ('Circle')
```

Even in this case we can make use of [property |#Properties, getters and setters] conventions and change the last line to:

```php
echo $circle->reflection->name; // returns 'Circle'
```


Reflection can be obtained without using `Nette\Object`:

```php
// getting PDO class reflection
$classReflection = new Nette\Reflection\ClassType('PDO');

// getting PDO::query method reflection
$methodReflection = new Nette\Reflection\Method('PDO', 'query');
```


Annotations
===========

Reflection has really a lot to do with annotations. The annotations are written into phpDoc comments (two opening asterisks are mandatory!) and start with `@`. You can annotate classes, variables and methods:

```php
/**
 * @author John Doe
 * @author Tomas Marny
 * @secured
 */
class FooClass
{
	/** @Persistent */
	public $foo;

	/** @User(loggedIn, role=Admin) */
	public function bar() {}
}
```

In the code there are these annotations:

- `@author John Doe` - string, contains text value `'John Doe'`
- `@Persistent` - boolean, its presence means `TRUE`
- `@User(loggedIn, role=Admin)` - contains associative `array('loggedIn', 'role' => 'Admin')`


The existence of a class annotation can be checked via `hasAnnotation()` method:


```php
$fooReflection = new Nette\Reflection\ClassType('FooClass');
$fooReflection->hasAnnotation('author'); // returns TRUE
$fooReflection->hasAnnotation('copyright'); // returns FALSE
```

Values can be acquired with `getAnnotation()`:

```php
$fooReflection->getAnnotation('author'); // returns string 'Tomas Marny'

$fooReflection->getMethod('bar')->getAnnotation('User');
// returns array('loggedIn', 'role' => 'Admin')
```

.[caution]
Previous definitions are overwritten with the latter ones, sou you will always get the last one.

All annotations can be obtained with `getAnnotations()`:

```
array(3) {
	"author" => array(2) {
		0 => string(8) "John Doe"
		1 => string(11) "Tomas Marny"
	}
	"secured" => array(1) {
		0 => bool(TRUE)
	}
}
```
