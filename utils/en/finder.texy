Finder: File Search
*******************

.[perex]
Need to find files matching a certain mask? The Finder can help you. It's a versatile and fast tool for browsing the directory structure.


Installation:

```shell
composer require nette/utils
```

The examples assume an alias has been created:

```php
use Nette\Utils\Finder;
```


Using
-----

First, let's see how you can use [api:Nette\Utils\Finder] to list the file names with the extensions `.txt` and `.md` in the current directory:

```php
foreach (Finder::findFiles(['*.txt', '*.md']) as $name => $file) {
	echo $file;
}
```

The default directory for the search is the current directory, but you can change it using the [in() or from() |#Where to search?] methods.
The `$file` variable is an instance of the [FileInfo |#FileInfo] class with lots of useful methods. The `$name` key contains the path to the file as a string.


What to Search For?
-------------------

In addition to the `findFiles()` method, there is also `findDirectories()`, which searches only directories, and `find()`, which searches both. These methods are static, so they can be called without creating an instance. The mask parameter is optional, if you don't specify it, everything is searched.

```php
foreach (Finder::find() as $file) {
	echo $file; // now all files and directories are listed
}
```

Use the `files()` and `directories()` methods to add what else to search for. The methods can be called repeatedly and an array of masks can be provided as a parameter:

```php
Finder::findDirectories('vendor') // all directories
	->files(['*.php', '*.phpt']); // plus all PHP files
```

An alternative to static methods is to create an instance using `new Finder` (the fresh object created this way does not search for anything) and specify what to search for using `files()` and `directories()`:

```php
(new Finder)
	->directories()      // all directories
	->files('*.php');    // plus all PHP files
```

You can use [#wildcards] `*`, `**`, `?` and `[...]` in the mask. You can even specify in directories, for example `src/*.php` will search for all PHP files in the `src` directory.

Symlinks are also considered directories or files.


Where to Search?
----------------

The default search directory is the current directory. You can change this by using the `in()` and `from()` methods. As you can see from the method names, `in()` searches only the current directory, while `from()` searches its subdirectories too (recursively). If you want to search recursively in the current directory, you can use `from('.')`.

These methods can be called multiple times or you can pass multiple paths to them as arrays, then files will be searched in all directories. If one of the directories does not exist, a `Nette\UnexpectedValueException` is thrown.

```php
Finder::findFiles('*.php')
	->in(['src', 'tests']) // searches directly in src/ and tests/
	->from('vendor');      // searches also in vendor/ subdirectories
```

Relative paths are relative to the current directory. Of course, absolute paths can also be specified:

```php
Finder::findFiles('*.php')
	->in('/var/www/html');
```

Wildcards [#wildcards] `*`, `**`, `?` can be used in the path. For example, you can use the path `src/*/*.php` to search for all PHP files in the second level directories in the `src` directory. The `**` character, called globstar, is a powerful trump card because it allows you to search subdirectories as well: use `src/**/tests/*.php` to search for all PHP files in the `tests` directory located in `src` or any of its subdirectories.

On the other hand, wildcards `[...]` characters are not supported in the path, i.e. they have no special meaning to avoid unwanted behavior in case you search for example `in(__DIR__)` and by chance `[]` characters appear in the path.

When searching files and directories in depth, the parent directory is returned first and then the files contained in it, which can be reversed with `childFirst()`.


Wildcards
---------

You can use several special characters in the mask:

- `*` - replaces any number of arbitrary characters (except `/`)
- `**` - replaces any number of arbitrary characters including `/` (i.e. can be searched multi-level)
- `?` - replaces one arbitrary character (except `/`)
- `[a-z]` - replaces one character from the list of characters in square brackets
- `[!a-z]` - replaces one character outside the list of characters in square brackets

Examples of use:

- `img/?.png` - files with the single-letter name `0.png`, `1.png`, `x.png`, etc.
- `logs/[0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9]-[01][0-9]-[0-3][0-9].log` - log files in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`
- `src/**/tests/*` - files in the directory `src/tests`, `src/foo/tests`, `src/foo/bar/tests` and so on.
- `docs/**.md` - all files with the extension `.md` in all subdirectories of the directory `docs`


Excluding
---------

Use the `exclude()` method to exclude files and directories from searches. You specify a mask that the file must not match. Example of searching for files `*.txt` except those containing the letter `X` in the name:

```php
Finder::findFiles('*.txt')
	->exclude('*X*');
```

Use `exclude()` to skip browsed subdirectories:

```php
Finder::findFiles('*.php')
	->from($dir)
	->exclude('temp', '.git')
```


Filtering
---------

The Finder offers several methods for filtering the results (i.e. reducing them). You can combine them and call them repeatedly.

Use `size()` to filter by file size. In this way, we find files with sizes between 100 and 200 bytes:

```php
Finder::findFiles('*.php')
	->size('>=', 100)
	->size('<=', 200);
```

The `date()` method filters by the date the file was last modified. The values can be absolute or relative to the current date and time, for example, this is how to find files changed in the last two weeks:

```php
Finder::findFiles('*.php')
	->date('>', '-2 weeks')
	->from($dir)
```

Both functions understand the operators `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`, `=`, `!=`, `<>`.

The Finder also allows you to filter results using custom functions. The function receives an `Nette\Utils\FileInfo` object as a parameter and must return `true` to include the file in the results.

Example: search for PHP files that contain the string `Nette` (case-insensitive):

```php
Finder::findFiles('*.php')
	->filter(fn($file) => strcasecmp($file->read(), 'Nette') === 0);
```


Depth Filtering
---------------

When searching recursively, you can set the maximum crawl depth using the `limitDepth()` method. If you set `limitDepth(1)`, only the first subdirectories are crawled, `limitDepth(0)` disables depth crawling, and a value of -1 cancels the limit.

The Finder allows you to use its own functions to decide which directory to enter when browsing. The function receives an `Nette\Utils\FileInfo` object as a parameter and must return `true` to enter the directory:

```php
Finder::findFiles('*.php')
	->descentFilter($file->getBasename() !== 'temp');
```


Sorting
-------

The Finder also offers several functions for sorting results.

The `sortByName()` method sorts results by file name. The sorting is natural, i.e. it correctly handles the numbers in the names and returns e.g. `foo1.txt` before `foo10.txt`.

The Finder also allows you to sort using a custom function. It takes two `Nette\Utils\FileInfo` objects as parameters and must return the result of the comparison with the operator `<=>`, i.e. `-1`, `0` nebo `1`. For example, this is how we sort files by size:

```php
$finder->sortBy(fn($a, $b) => $a->getSize() <=> $b->getSize());
```


Multiple Different Searches
---------------------------

If you need to find multiple different files in different locations or that meet different criteria, use the `append()` method. It returns a new `Finder` object so you can chain method calls:


```php
($finder = new Finder) // store the first Finder in the $finder variable!
	->files('*.php')   // search for *.php files in src/
	->from('src')
	->append()
	->files('*.md')    // in docs/ look for *.md files
	->from('docs')
	->append()
	->files('*.json'); // in the current folder look for *.json files
```

Alternatively, you can use the `append()` method to add a specific file (or an array of files). Then it returns the same object `Finder`:

```php
$finder = Finder::findFiles('*.txt')
	->append(__FILE__);
```


FileInfo
--------

[Nette\Utils\FileInfo |api:] is a class representing a file or directory in the search results. It is an extension of the [SplFileInfo |php:SplFileInfo] class that provides information such as file size, last modified date, name, path, etc.

Additionally, it provides methods for returning relative paths, which is useful when browsing in depth:

```php
foreach (Finder::findFiles('*.jpg')->from('.') as $file) {
	$absoluteFilePath = $file->getRealPath();
	$relativeFilePath = $file->getRelativePathname();
}
```

You also have methods for reading and writing the contents of a file:

```php
foreach ($finder as $file) {
    $contents = $file->read();
    // ...
    $file->write($contents);
}
```


Returning Results as an Array
-----------------------------

As seen in the examples, the Finder implements the `IteratorAggregate` interface , so you can use `foreach` to browse the results. It's programmed so that results are only loaded as you browse, so if you have a large number of files, it doesn't wait for them all to be read.

You can also have the results returned as an array of `Nette\Utils\FileInfo` objects, using the `collect()` method. The array is not associative, but numeric.

```php
$array = $finder->findFiles('*.php')->collect();
```
