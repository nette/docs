Test Annotations
****************

.[warning]
Following annotations are evaluated only if we run the test by the Tester, not manually as ordinary PHP script.

We write annotations at the beginning of the test file and the typing is case-insensitive. Imaginary example:

```php
/**
 * TEST: Basic database query test.
 *
 * @dataProvider files/databases.ini
 * @exitCode 56
 * @phpVersion < 5.5
 */

require __DIR__ . '/../bootstrap.php';
```


TEST:
-----
It is not an annotation actually. It only sets the test title which is printed on fail or into logs.


@skip
-----
Test is skipped. It is handy for temporary test deactivation.


@phpVersion
-----------
Test is skipped if is not run by the corresponding PHP version. We write annotation as `@phpVersion [operator] version`. We can leave out the operator, default is `>=`. Examples:

```php
/**
 * @phpVersion 5.3.3
 * @phpVersion < 5.5
 * @phpVersion != 5.4.5
 */
```


@phpExtension
-------------
Test is skipped if all mentioned PHP extension are not loaded. Multiple extensions can be written in a single annotation, or we can use the annotation multiple times.

```php
/**
 * @phpExtension pdo, pdo_pgsql, pdo_mysql
 * @phpExtension json
 */
```


@dataProvider
-------------
We write annotation as `@dataProvider file.ini`. INI file path is relative to the test file. Test runs as many times as number of sections contained in the INI file. Let's assume the INI file `databases.ini`:

```ini
[mysql]
dsn = "mysql:host=127.0.0.1"
user = root
password = ******

[postgresql]
dsn = "pgsql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test"
user = postgres
password = ******

[sqlite]
dsn = "sqlite::memory:"
```

and the file `database.phpt` in the same directory:

```php
/**
 * @dataProvider databases.ini
 */

$args = Tester\Environment::loadData();
```

The test runs three times and `$args` will contain values from sections **mysql**, **postgresql** or **sqlite**.

There is one more variation when we write annotations with a question mark as `@dataProvider? file.ini`. In this case, test is skipped if the INI file doesn't exist.

Annotation possibilities have not been mentioned all yet. We can write conditions after the INI file. Test runs for the given section only if all conditions match. Let's extend the INI file:

```ini
[mysql]
dsn = "mysql:host=127.0.0.1"
user = root
password = ******

[postgresql 8.4]
dsn = "pgsql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test"
user = postgres
password = ******

[postgresql 9.1]
dsn = "pgsql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test;port=5433"
user = postgres
password = ******

[sqlite]
dsn = "sqlite::memory:"
```

and we will use annotation with condition:

```php
/**
 * @dataProvider  databases.ini  postgresql, >=9.0
 */
```

The test runs only once for section `postgresql 9.1`. Other sections don’t match the conditions.

Similarly, we can pass path to a PHP script instead of INI. It must return array or Traversable. File `databases.php`:

```php
return [
	'postgresql 8.4' => [
		'dsn' => '...',
		'user' => '...',
	],

	'postgresql 9.1' => [
		'dsn' => '...',
		'user' => '...',
	],
];
```


@multiple
---------
We write it as `@multiple N` where **N** is an integer. Test runs exactly N-times.


@testCase
---------
Annotation has no parameters. We use it when we write a test as `Tester\TestCase` classes. In this case, the test runs as many times as the number of testing methods. Every testing method runs in a separated process. It can dramatically speed up the whole testing procedure. We recommend usage of this annotation.


@exitCode
---------
We write it as `@exitCode N` where **N** is the exit code of the test. For example if `exit(10)` is called in the test, we write annotation as `@exitCode 10`. It is considered to fail if the test ends with a different code. Exit code 0 (zero) is verified if we leave out the annotation


@httpCode
---------
Annotation is evaluated only if PHP binary is CGI. It is ignored otherwise. We write it as `@httpCode NNN` where **NNN** is expected HTTP code. HTTP code 200 is verified if we leave out the annotation. If we write `NNN` as a string evaluated as zero, for example `any`, HTTP code is not checked at all.


@outputMatch a @outputMatchFile
-------------------------------
The behavior of annotations is consistent with `Assert::match()` and `Assert::matchFile()` assertions. But pattern is found in test’s standard output. A suitable use case is when we assume the test to end by fatal error and we need to verify its output.


@phpIni
-------
It sets INI configuration values for test. For example we write it as `@phpIni precision=20` and it works in the same way as if we passed value from the command line by parameter `-d precision=20`.
