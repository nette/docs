This document describes rules and recommendations for developing applications and class libraries using the PHP language.


Common Naming Conventions
=========================

- Always choose meaningful and specific names.
- Avoid using abbreviations unless the full name is excessive.
- Use uppercase for two-letter abbreviations, and Pascal Case for longer abbreviations.
- Use only alphanumeric characters in names

PHP Files
=========

- For files that contain only PHP code, the closing tag (`?>`) is never permitted. Not including it prevents trailing whitespace from being accidentally injected into the output.

- Use an indent of 1 tab.

- The recommended line length is 80 characters, i.e. developers should aim keep code as close to the 80-column boundary as it is practical.

- PHP code must always be delimited by the full-form PHP tags: `<?php ... ?>`

- File name should match class name if possible.

For all other files, only alphanumeric characters, underscores, and the dash character (`-`) are permitted. Spaces are prohibited. Any file that contains any PHP code must end with the extension `.php`, or `.phtml` in case of templates.


Strings
=======

When a string is literal (contains no variable substitutions), the single quote must always used to demarcate the string. Exception: when a literal string itself contains apostrophes, it is permitted to demarcate the string with double quotes.

Strings may be concatenated using the `.` operator. A space must always be added before and after the `.` operator to improve readability. It is permitted to break the statement into multiple lines - each successive line should be padded with whitespace such that the `.` operator is aligned under the `=` operator:

/--php
$sql = "SELECT `id`, `name` FROM `people` "
     . "WHERE `name` = 'Susan' "
     . "ORDER BY `name` ASC ";
\--


Arrays
======

When declaring indexed arrays, a trailing space must be added after each comma delimiter to improve readability:

/--php
$sampleArray = array(1, 2, 3, 'test');
\--

When declaring associative arrays, it is encouraged to put each key and value pair on separated line, indented by 1 tab. After last pair the comma must be added.

/--php
$sampleArray = array(
    'firstKey'  => 'firstValue',
    'secondKey' => 'secondValue',
);
\--



Classes
=======

Naming conventions:
- PascalCase
- Use a noun or noun phrase for class name.
- Add an appropriate class-suffix when sub-classing another type when possible.
- Examples: TexyParser, HttpRequest

Coding Style:
- The brace is always written on the line underneath the class name.
- Every class must have a documentation block.
- Any code within a class must be indented by 1 tab.

Placing additional code in a class file is permitted but discouraged (static constructor calling is allowed). In these files, two blank lines must separate the class from any additional PHP code in the file.

Class members implementation should follow this order as it is practical:
1) Member Variables
  a) public
  b) protected
  c) private
2) Constructor, Destructor
3) Properties
4) Methods
  a) public
  b) protected
  c) private

The ultimate ancestor of all instantiable classes should be `Nette\Object`.

Interfaces
==========

Interface classes must follow the same conventions as other classes, however must begin with `I` letter. Example: `IPresenter`



Member variables
================

Naming conventions:
- camelCase
- Variables and properties must describe an entity not the type or size.
- Do not include the parent class name within a property name.

Variables should always be as verbose as practical. Terse variable names such as `$i` and `$n` are discouraged for anything other than the smallest loop contexts.

Variables must have documentation block with `@var` directive and specified type.


Class properties
================

Properties are OOP enhancement provided by `Nette\Object`. They must follow the same conventions as other variables. Accessors must be prefixed with either `get` or `set` (followed by upper case letter) and declared as `public`. Getter is required, setter is optional.

Example:

/--php
public function getName()

public function setName()

$obj->name
\--


Constants
=========

They must always have all letters capitalized, separated by underscore characters.

Example: CONTENT_TEXTUAL, FIELD_NUMERIC

Constants must be defined as class members by using the `const` construct. Defining constants in the global scope with `define` is permitted but discouraged.




Functions and Methods
=====================

Definitions
-----------

Naming conventions:
- camelCase
- Try to use a verb or verb-object pair.
- If method returns boolean, try to prefix name with "is", "can", "has" or similar meaningful prefix.
- Names must be as verbose as is practical to enhance the understandability of code.
- Examples: fetchPairs(), getElementById(), isSubmitted()

Functions in the global scope are permitted but strongly discouraged (except extension methods). It is highly recommended that these functions should be wrapped in a static class.

Methods must always declare their visibility by using one of the `private`, `protected`, or `public` constructs.

Like classes, the brace is always written on the line underneath the function name. There is no space between the function name and the opening parenthesis for the arguments. All arguments should have type hint if possible.

Functions and methods must have documentation block with `@param` directive and specified types of all of the arguments.

This is an example of an acceptable function declaration in a class:

/--php
/**
 * Documentation block here
 */
class Foo
{
	/**
	 * Documentation block here
	 */
	public function verb()
	{
		// entire content of function
		// must be indented by 1 tab
	}
}
\--

The return value must not be enclosed in parentheses. This can hinder readability and can also break code if a method is later changed to return by reference.

Usage
-----

Function arguments are separated by a single trailing space after the comma delimiter. This is an example of an acceptable function call for a function that takes three arguments:

/--php
fooBar(1, 2, 3);
\--

Call-time pass by-reference is prohibited.

For functions whose arguments permitted arrays, the function call may include the "array" construct and can be split into multiple lines to improve readability. In these cases, the standards for writing arrays still apply:

/--php
fooBar(array(1, 2, 3), 2, 3);

fooBar(1, 2, array(
	'firstKey'  => 'firstValue',
	'secondKey' => 'secondValue',
), 3, 4);
\--

Control Statements
==================

`if` `else` based statements
----------------------------

Control statements based on the `if` and `elseif` constructs must have a single space before the opening parenthesis of the conditional, and a single space after the closing parenthesis.

The opening brace is written on the same line as the conditional statement. The closing brace is always written on its own line. Any content within the braces must be indented by 1 tab.

Comparison "strong typed" operators (`===` and `!==`) are preferred before "weak typed" ones (`==` and `!=`). If weak typed comparison operator is used, the intention must be documented with a comment.

/--php
if ($a != 2) { // intentionally !=
	$a = 2;
}
\--

For `if` statements that include `elseif` or `else`, the formatting must be as in these examples:

/--php
if ($a !== 2) {
	$a = 2;
} elseif ($a === 3) {
	$a = 4;
} else {
	$a = 7;
}
\--

`switch` based statements
-------------------------

Control statements written with the `switch` construct must have a single space before the opening parenthesis of the conditional statement, and also a single space after the closing parenthesis.

All content under each `case` (or `default`) statement must be indented by 1 tab.

/--php
switch ($numPeople) {
case 1:
	break;

case 2:
	break;

default:
	break;
}
\--

It is sometimes useful to write a case statement which falls through to the next case by not including a break or return in that case. To distinguish these cases from bugs, any case statement where break or return are omitted must contain the comment `// break intentionally omitted`.
