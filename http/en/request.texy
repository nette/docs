HTTP Request
************

.[perex]
Nette encapsulates the HTTP request into objects with an understandable API while providing a sanitization filter.

An HTTP request is an [api:Nette\Http\Request] object, which you get by passing it using [dependency injection |dependency-injection:passing-dependencies]. In presenters simply call `$httpRequest = $this->getHttpRequest()`.

What is important is that Nette when [creating|#RequestFactory] this object, it clears all GET, POST and COOKIE input parameters as well as URLs of control characters and invalid UTF-8 sequences. So you can safely continue working with the data. The cleaned data is then used in presenters and forms.

Nette\Http\Request
==================

This object is immutable. It has no setters, it has only one so-called wither `withUrl()`, which does not change the object, but returns a new instance with a modified value.


withUrl(Nette\Http\UrlScript $url): Nette\Http\Request .[method]
----------------------------------------------------------------
Returns a clone with a different URL.


getUrl(): Nette\Http\UrlScript .[method]
----------------------------------------
Returns the URL of the request as object [UrlScript|urls#UrlScript].

```php
$url = $httpRequest->getUrl();
echo $url; // https://nette.org/en/documentation?action=edit
echo $url->getHost(); // nette.org
```

Browsers do not send a fragment to the server, so `$url->getFragment()` will return an empty string.


getQuery(string $key = null): string|array|null .[method]
---------------------------------------------------------
Returns GET request parameters:

```php
$all = $httpRequest->getQuery();    // array of all URL parameters
$id = $httpRequest->getQuery('id'); // returns GET parameter 'id' (or null)
```


getPost(string $key = null): string|array|null .[method]
--------------------------------------------------------
Returns POST request parameters:

```php
$all = $httpRequest->getPost();     // array of all POST parameters
$id = $httpRequest->getPost('id');  // returns POST parameter 'id' (or null)
```


getFile(string|string[] $key): Nette\Http\FileUpload|array|null .[method]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Returns [upload|#Uploaded Files] as object [api:Nette\Http\FileUpload]:

```php
$file = $httpRequest->getFile('avatar');
if ($file->hasFile()) { // was any file uploaded?
	$file->getUntrustedName(); // name of the file sent by user
	$file->getSanitizedName(); // the name without dangerous characters
}
```

Specify an array of keys to access the subtree structure.

```php
//<input type="file" name="my-form[details][avatar]" multiple>
$file = $request->getFile(['my-form', 'details', 'avatar']);
```

Because you can't trust data from the outside and therefore don't rely on the form of the structure, this method is safer than `$request->getFiles()['my-form']['details']['avatar']`, which can fail.


getFiles(): array .[method]
---------------------------
Returns tree of [upload files|#Uploaded Files] in a normalized structure, with each leaf an instance of [api:Nette\Http\FileUpload]:

```php
$files = $httpRequest->getFiles();
```


getCookie(string $key): string|array|null .[method]
---------------------------------------------------
Returns a cookie or `null` if it does not exist.

```php
$sessId = $httpRequest->getCookie('sess_id');
```


getCookies(): array .[method]
-----------------------------
Returns all cookies:

```php
$cookies = $httpRequest->getCookies();
```


getMethod(): string .[method]
-----------------------------
Returns the HTTP method with which the request was made.

```php
echo $httpRequest->getMethod(); // GET, POST, HEAD, PUT
```


isMethod(string $method): bool .[method]
----------------------------------------
Checks the HTTP method with which the request was made. The parameter is case-insensitive.

```php
if ($httpRequest->isMethod('GET')) // ...
```


getHeader(string $header): ?string .[method]
--------------------------------------------
Returns an HTTP header or `null` if it does not exist. The parameter is case-insensitive:

```php
$userAgent = $httpRequest->getHeader('User-Agent');
```


getHeaders(): array .[method]
-----------------------------
Returns all HTTP headers as associative array:

```php
$headers = $httpRequest->getHeaders();
echo $headers['Content-Type'];
```


getReferer(): ?Nette\Http\UrlImmutable .[method]
------------------------------------------------
What URL did the user come from? Beware, it is not reliable at all.


isSecured(): bool .[method]
---------------------------
Is the connection encrypted (HTTPS)? You may need to [set up a proxy|configuration#HTTP proxy] for proper functionality.


isSameSite(): bool .[method]
----------------------------
Is the request coming from the same (sub) domain and is initiated by clicking on a link? Nette uses the `_nss` cookie (formerly `nette-samesite`) to detect it.


isAjax(): bool .[method]
------------------------
Is it an AJAX request?


getRemoteAddress(): ?string .[method]
-------------------------------------
Returns the user's IP address. You may need to [set up a proxy|configuration#HTTP proxy] for proper functionality.


getRemoteHost(): ?string .[method deprecated]
---------------------------------------------
Returns DNS translation of the user's IP address. You may need to [set up a proxy|configuration#HTTP proxy] for proper functionality.


getBasicCredentials(): ?string .[method]{data-version:v3.2}
-----------------------------------------------------------
Returns [Basic HTTP authentication |https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication] credentials.

```php
[$user, $password] = $httpRequest->getBasicCredentials();
```


getRawBody(): ?string .[method]
-------------------------------
Returns the body of the HTTP request:

```php
$body = $httpRequest->getRawBody();
```


detectLanguage(array $langs): ?string .[method]
-----------------------------------------------
Detects language. As a parameter `$lang`, we pass an array of languages ​​that the application supports, and it returns the one preferred by browser. It is not magic, the method just uses the `Accept-Language` header. If no match is reached, it returns `null`.

```php
// Header sent by browser: Accept-Language: cs,en-us;q=0.8,en;q=0.5,sl;q=0.3

$langs = ['hu', 'pl', 'en']; // languages supported in application
echo $httpRequest->detectLanguage($langs); // en
```


RequestFactory
==============

The object of the current HTTP request is created by [api:Nette\Http\RequestFactory]. If you are writing an application that does not use a DI container, you create a request as follows:

```php
$factory = new Nette\Http\RequestFactory;
$httpRequest = $factory->fromGlobals();
```

RequestFactory can be configured before calling `fromGlobals()`. We can disable all sanitization of input parameters from invalid UTF-8 sequences using `$factory->setBinary()`. And also set up a proxy server, which is important for the correct detection of the user's IP address using `$factory->setProxy(...)`.

It's possible to clean up URLs from characters that can get into them because of poorly implemented comment systems on various other websites by using filters:

```php
// remove spaces from path
$requestFactory->urlFilters['path']['%20'] = '';

// remove dot, comma or right parenthesis form the end of the URL
$requestFactory->urlFilters['url']['[.,)]$'] = '';

// clean the path from duplicated slashes (default filter)
$requestFactory->urlFilters['path']['/{2,}'] = '/';
```


Uploaded Files
==============

Method `Nette\Http\Request::getFiles()` return a tree of upload files in a normalized structure, with each leaf an instance of [api:Nette\Http\FileUpload]. These objects encapsulate the data submitted by the `<input type=file>` form element.

The structure reflects the naming of elements in HTML. In the simplest example, this might be a single named form element submitted as:

```latte
<input type="file" name="avatar">
```

In this case, the `$request->getFiles()` returns array:

```php
[
	'avatar' => /* FileUpload instance */
]
```

The `FileUpload` object is created even if the user did not upload any file or the upload failed. Method `hasFile()` returns true if a file has been sent:

```php
$request->getFile('avatar')->hasFile();
```

In the case of an input using array notation for the name:

```latte
<input type="file" name="my-form[details][avatar]">
```

returned tree ends up looking like this:

```php
[
	'my-form' => [
		'details' => [
			'avatar' => /* FileUpload instance */
		],
	],
]
```

You can also create arrays of files:

```latte
<input type="file" name="my-form[details][avatars][] multiple">
```

In such a case structure looks like:

```php
[
	'my-form' => [
		'details' => [
			'avatars' => [
				0 => /* FileUpload instance */,
				1 => /* FileUpload instance */,
				2 => /* FileUpload instance */,
			],
		],
	],
]
```

The best way to access index 1 of a nested array is as follows:

```php
$file = $request->getFile(['my-form', 'details', 'avatars', 1]);
if ($file instanceof FileUpload) {
	// ...
}
```

Because you can't trust data from the outside and therefore don't rely on the form of the structure, this method is safer than `$request->getFiles()['my-form']['details']['avatars'][1]`, which can fail.

Requires PHP extension `fileinfo`.


getUntrustedName(): string .[method]
------------------------------------
Returns the original file name as submitted by the browser. In nette/http 3.0 and earlier, the method was called `getName()`.

.[caution]
Do not trust the value returned by this method. A client could send a malicious filename with the intention to corrupt or hack your application.


getSanitizedName(): string .[method]
