DI: Creating Extensions
***********************

`Configurator` does not generate the code itself, that is the task of [api:Nette\DI\Compiler] and [api:Nette\DI\ContainerBuilder] classes. First configuration files are loaded and passed to `Compiler`. Add your own extension to `Compiler` via `config.neon`:

```neon
extensions:
	blog: MyBlogExtension
```

Each `Compiler` extension must extend [api:Nette\DI\CompilerExtension] and can implement three different methods that are called successively during the `Container` compilation.


CompilerExtension::loadConfiguration() .[method]
================================================

This method is called first and loads additional configuration files, creates methods using [api:Nette\DI\ContainerBuilder] and most importantly processes the application's configuration.

Config can contain a section bearing the same name as your extension. Using the last example, following lines can appear in your config file:

```neon
blog: # same name as your extension
	postsPerPage: 10
	comments: FALSE
```

Use `$this->config` in the extension to list its configuration.

```php
class MyBlogExtension extends Nette\DI\CompilerExtension
{
	public function loadConfiguration()
	{
		dump($this->config);
		// array(2) [ 'postsPerPage' => 10, 'comments' => FALSE ]
```

Honoring the "convention over configuration":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration principle we can set default values and be able to use the application without explicitly setting anything, and merge them with configuration.

```php
class MyBlogExtension extends Nette\DI\CompilerExtension
{
	public $defaults = array(
		'postsPerPage' => 5,
		'comments' => TRUE
	);

	public function loadConfiguration()
	{
		$this->config += $this->defaults;
```

Now we have the complete configuration in the `$this->config` array and can use it while creating the services. `ContainerBuilder` class allows you to use the same way of service description as NEON used in the configuration files.

```php
$builder = $this->getContainerBuilder();
```

Let's create an `articles` service as an example: an object `MyBlog\ArticlesModel` and we'll call its method `setLogger`.

.[tip]
Convention is to prefix services by their name to avoid conflicts. Using `prefix()` method we can then access the service via `$container->getService('blog.articles`).

```php
$builder->addDefinition($this->prefix('articles'))
	->setFactory('MyBlog\ArticlesModel', array('@connection'))
	->addSetup('setLogger', array('@logger'));
```


Loading additional configurations
---------------------------------

If you prefer configuration files over extensions, you can move some of the definitions into separate configuration file.

```neon
services:
	articles:
		factory: MyBlog\ArticlesModel(@connection)

	comments:
		factory: MyBlog\CommentsModel(@connection, @blog_articles)

	articlesList:
		factory: MyBlog\Components\ArticlesList(@blog_articles)
```

Load the file and set additional services

```php
public function loadConfiguration()
{
	$this->config += $this->defaults;
	$builder = $this->getContainerBuilder();

	// load additional config file for this extension
	$this->compiler->parseServices($builder, $this->loadFromFile(__DIR__ . '/blog.neon'), $this->name);

	// set a number of articles per page in the component
	$builder->getDefinition('blog_articlesList')
		->addSetup('setPostsPerPage', array($this->config['postsPerPage']));

	// optional disabling of commenting
	if (!$this->config['comments']) {
		$builder->getDefinition('blog_comments')
			->addSetup('disableComments');
	}
}
```


CompilerExtension::beforeCompile() .[method]
============================================

In `beforeCompile` phase we should not add any more services, however you can modify already existing ones or add relations between services (for example using tags).


CompilerExtension::afterCompile() .[method]
===========================================

In this phase the `Container` instance is already generated and contains all service methods and is ready to be stored into cache. Thanks to [api:Nette\PhpGenerator\ClassType] you can add your own code to the container to modify the service generation.

To inspire yourself take a look at Nette Framework's `initialize` method, which Nette adds to process [some of the user settings |api:Nette\DI\Extensions\NetteExtension::afterCompile()]. This method is always called after instantiation of the container.

Here is a piece of code of `initialize` where Nette adds a session start and autorun of services marked with `run` tag.

```php
public function afterCompile(Nette\PhpGenerator\ClassType $class)
{
	$container = $this->getContainerBuilder();

	// initialize method
	$initialize = $class->getMethod('initialize');

	// automatic session start
	if ($this->config['session']['autoStart']) {
		$initialize->addBody('$this->session->start();');
	}

	// services with run tag must be run after instantition of the container
	foreach ($container->findByTag('run') as $name => $foo) {
		$initialize->addBody('$this->getService(?);', array($name));
	}
}
```
