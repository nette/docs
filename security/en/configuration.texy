Configuring Access Control
**************************

.[perex]
Overview of configuration options for Nette Security.

If you are not using the entire framework, but only this library, read [how to load the configuration|bootstrap:].

You can define a list of users in the configuration to create a [simple authenticator|authentication] (`Nette\Security\SimpleAuthenticator`). Because passwords are listed in plain text in the configuration, this solution is suitable for testing purposes only.

```neon
security:
	# show the user panel in Tracy Bar?
	debugger: ...  # (bool) defaults to true

	users:
		# name: password
		johndoe: secret123

		# name, password, roles, and other data available in the identity
		janedoe:
			password: secret123
			roles: [admin]
			data: ...
```

Furthermore, you can define roles and resources to create a basis for an [authorizer|authorization] (`Nette\Security\Permission`):

```neon
security:
	roles:
		guest:
		registered: [guest]  # registered inherits from guest
		admin: [registered]  # and admin inherits from registered

	resources:
		article:
		comment: [article]   # resource inherits from article
		poll:
```


User Storage
------------

You can configure how to store information about the logged-in user:

```neon
security:
	authentication:
		# period of inactivity after which the user will be logged out
		expiration: 30 minutes        # (string) default is not set

		# where to store information about the logged-in user
		storage: session              # (session|cookie) default is session
```

If you choose `cookie` as the storage, you can also set these options:

```neon
security:
	authentication:
		# name of the cookie
		cookieName: userId            # (string) defaults to userid

		# domains that can receive the cookie
		cookieDomain: 'example.com'   # (string|domain)

		# restriction for cross-origin access
		cookieSamesite: None          # (Strict|Lax|None) defaults to Lax
```


DI Services
-----------

These services are added to the DI container:

| Name                    | Type                               | Description
|-------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------
| `security.authenticator`| [api:Nette\Security\Authenticator] | [authenticator |authentication]
| `security.authorizator` | [api:Nette\Security\Authorizator]  | [authorizer |authorization]
| `security.passwords`    | [api:Nette\Security\Passwords]     | [password hashing |passwords]
| `security.user`         | [api:Nette\Security\User]          | current user
| `security.userStorage`  | [api:Nette\Security\UserStorage]   | [storage |#User Storage]
