Syntax
******

--> "Detailed syntax description":syntax-full


The Texy tool was created to allow inexperienced users to easily edit the content of web pages. Therefore, the syntax is maximally intuitive. The intention is that the text in pure (unformatted) form is clear and its format can be guessed.

Today, Texy also serves well-experienced HTML experts. Allows you to freely combine Texy notation with HTML tags. Thus, experienced users do not have to learn a new meta-language and make full use of their knowledge. Texy only simplifies their work.

The primary logic of the syntax is **not to use any syntax**. Just write plain text. Inserting advanced information, such as CSS classes or links, does not disrupt the flow of text. And it is written in a way that even non-technical users can easily understand.


Paragraphs .[#paragraph]
========================

A paragraph is considered to be one or more consecutive lines of text. The paragraphs are separated by a blank line.

/--code texy
First paragraph lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

Second paragraph, který tvoří jeden řádek.
And second line of paragraph. Texy will join the lines.
\--

To wrap a line in a paragraph, insert one space to the left:

/--code texy
April is the cruellest month, breeding
 Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
 Memory and desire, stirring
 Dull roots with spring rain.
\--


Headings .[#heading]
====================

Headings can be written in two ways: **underlined** or **surrounded**.

Each headline has its own degree. In the case of **underlined**, the importance of the title is decided by the underline character. From the highest to the lowest, these are: `#` `*` `=` `-`

/--code texy
Head title
**********


Subtitle
========
\--

For **surrounded** titles, the level determines the number of preceding characters. It can be `#` nebo `=`

The following applies: the more characters, the more important the title (minimum two characters, maximum seven).

/--code texy
=== Head title ===

## Subtitle
\--

As you can see in the case of the subtitle, the characters on the right can be omitted.


Horizontal Lines .[#horizline]
==============================

Texy knows these notations:


/--code texy
------------

********
\--


Turning Off the Texy .[#disable-Texy]
=====================================

The keyword `html` or` text` affects whether the content will be understood as HTML (including tags) or plain text.

/--code texy
  /---html
    <em>example</em>: **this is not strong**
  \---


  /---text
    <em>example</em>: **this is not strong**
  \---
\--

To turn off Texy inline, it is possible to use a double apostrophe `''` and wrap a part of the text that is not to be Texy processed.

/--code texy
   Example: ''**this is not strong**''
\--


Quotes .[#blockquote]
=====================

Quotes are indented, similarly to emails, by a character `>`

/--code texy
> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs.
>
> 640 K should be enough for everyone
\--


Links .[#link]
==============

Links are written by enclosing the referencing text in quotation marks, followed by a colon and a URL. Texy tries to intelligently guess the end of the URL. You can also help it by enclosing the URL in square brackets. The `http://` section is optional.

It is also possible to insert emails as a link, Texy transforms them into a form that should confuse spambots.

/--code texy
Look at homepage:[https://texy.info].

Do you know "La Trine":https://www.latrine.cz?

"Write me":me@example.com
\--


Images .[#image]
================

They are written between square brackets with an asterisk:

/--code texy
[* image.gif .(alternative text) *]
\--


In text paragraphs, you often need to choose whether the image should be left-aligned or right-aligned. To do this, use the `<` and `>` character used before the right parenthesis:

/--code texy
[* image.gif <] Left-aligned image. Lorem ipsum ...

[* image.gif >] Right-aligned image. Curabitur quam ...
\--


Figure with Caption
-------------------

Enter three asterisks after the image, followed by a caption:


/--code texy
[* image.gif *] *** This is the *caption* below the image
\--


Phrases .[#phrase]
==================

Probably the most used syntax in Texy. In almost all cases, a double character is used.

/--code texy
//italics//

**bold**

x^2 + y^3
\--


/--div .[output]
//italics//

**bold**

x^2 + y^3
\--


Texts can also be temporarily turned off - the content will not be formatted and will be displayed literally:

/--code texy
Remove ''<br />'' and entity ''&ndash''
\--


Direct HTML .[#html]
====================

Texy is not a substitute for HTML. It also doesn't look for alternative ways to write HTML. The goal is to simplify content writing. If you find it easier to write a structure directly in HTML, you can do so. HTML tags are fully supported.

/--code texy
This <strong class=info>is strong</strong> text.
<br> This is not.
\--


Lists .[#list]
==============

Bulleted lists are written using `*`, `+` or `-`. It must be written at the very beginning of the line and followed by a space.

/--code texy
-   Red
-   Green
-   Blue
\--


Numbered Lists
--------------

Texy knows these five ways of writing (the first two are equivalent):

/--code texy
1)  Learn
2)  Learn
3)  Learn

a)  Long
b)  Wide
c)  Shortsighted

A)  DOS
B)  Windows
C)  Linux

I)  Yesterday
II)  Today
III)  Tomorrow
\--


Nested Lists
------------

/--code texy
a)  Bird
  I)  Bird
    -   Red
    -   Green
    -   Blue
  II)  McHale
  III)  Parish
b)  McHale
c)  Parish
      1)  Bird
      2)  McHale
      3)  Parish
\--

Modifiers .[#modifier]
======================

Texy's most powerful weapon. The following types of modifiers can be used:

- (caption) adds a title to the object (or alternative text to images)
- `[class1 class2 #id]` specifying the class and / or ID of the element
- {class: blue} direct style notation
- {target: _blank} or direct entry of HTML attributes
- horizontal alignment:
   - left <
   - right >
   - centered <>
   - to block =

- vertical alignment: (only for tables)
   - up ^
   - center -
   - down _

Modifiers are written continuously (without spaces) and **must be preceded by a dot**. So for example `.(description)[left]` sets the title attribute to `description` and the class to `left`.

**Modifiers are always written rightmost**.

Example of applying a modifier to a paragraph of text:

/--code texy
Centered with a modifier  .<>

Colored by a modifier .{color:blue; lang: cs}
\--

/--code html
<p style="text-align:center">Centered with a modifier</p>

<p style="color:blue" lang="cs">Colored by a modifier</p>
\--


Typography .[#typography]
=========================

This includes all modifications and replacements of the text that modify its appearance in accordance with typographic rules and the like:

/--code texy
- "English" 'typographic' quotation marks
- dash vs. hyphen: 10-15 vs. česko-slovenský
- dash: one -- two
- typographic cross for dimensions 10 x 20
- arrows <- and -> and <-> ;
- three dots...
- preservation of HTML entities &amp;
- replacing (TM) or (R) with the relevant entities (C)
\--

/--div .[output]
- "English" 'typographic' quotation marks
- dash vs. hyphen: 10-15 vs. česko-slovenský
- dash: one -- two
- typographic cross for dimensions 10 x 20
- arrows <- and -> and <-> ;
- three dots...
- preservation of HTML entities &amp;
- replacing (TM) or (R) with the relevant entities (C)
\--

Spaces handling:

/--code texy
- inserting unbreakable spaces for one-letter prepositions (a car)
- unbreakable spaces for telephone numbers +420 776 552 046
\--

/--code html
inserting unbreakable spaces for one-letter prepositions (a&nbsp;car)

unbreakable spaces for telephone numbers +420&nbsp;776&nbsp;552&nbsp;046
\--

*Note: Replacements are usually governed by other rules that determine when
symbol replace and when not. For example, the arrow `->` cannot be at the end of a line, etc. So don't be surprised if in some cases Texy doesn't make the substitution.*


Abbreviations, Acronyms .[#acronym]
-----------------------------------

Double parenthetical notation is used:

/--code texy
one word: NATO((North Atlantic Treaty Organisation))

multiword: "et al."((and more))
\--


Clickable Web Addresses
-----------------------

Automatic conversion of web addresses and emails into a clickable form

/--code texy
more information at www.texy.info and also ...
\--

/--div .[output]
more information at www.texy.info and also ...
\--


Long Words Hyphenation .[#longwords]
====================================

Very interesting and important function of Texy. Long words can disrupt the appearance of the page, so it's a good idea to tell your browser where to wrap them. Texy searches for these places taking into account national customs, so he divides the word according to syllables:

/--code texy
nejneobhospodařovávatelnějšími
\--

/--code html
nejneobhospoda&shy;řovávatelnější&shy;mi</p
\--

*Note: the word length limit is optional*


Tables .[#table]
================

Example of a simple table, columns are separated by a character `|`

/--code texy
| first col | second col | third col
| Adam      | Eva        | Franta
\--

And the result is:

| first col | second col | third col
| Adam      | Eva        | Franta


The table header can be defined with this notation:

/--code texy
|-----------------------------
| First Name | Last Name | Age
|----------------------------
| Jesus      | Christ    | 33
| Cecilie    | Svobodova | 74
\--

|-----------------------------
| First Name | Last Name | Age
|----------------------------
| Jesus      | Christ    | 33
| Cecilie    | Svobodova | 74


Merging Columns
---------------

Notice the double `||`:

/--code texy
| Name                  || Age
|----------------------------
| Jesus      | Christ    | 33
\--

| Name                  || Age
|----------------------------
| Jesus      | Christ    | 33


Merging Rows
------------

Notice the `^` character symbolizing the upward direction:


/--code texy
| First Name | Last Name | Age
|----------------------------
| Bill                  || 50
|                       ^| 52
| Jim        | Beam      | 70
\--

| First Name | Last Name | Age
|----------------------------
| Bill                  || 50
|                       ^| 52
| Jim        | Beam      | 70
