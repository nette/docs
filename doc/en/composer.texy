Composer
********

<div class=perex>

Composer is a tool for managing your dependencies in PHP. It allows us to declare library dependencies and it will install them for us, into our project. We will learn

- how to install Composer
- use in new or existing project
- create and publish our of own package

</div>


Installation
============

Composer is distributed as runnable `.phar` file, and you can [download the latest version here |http://getcomposer.org/composer.phar].


Linux
-----

If you're using Linux, it's suggested to install the Composer using its installer

```shell
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

By copying into folder that is in system's `PATH`

```shell
$ mv ./composer.phar ~/bin/composer # or /usr/local/bin/composer
```

Composer becomes globally accessible under simple command

```shell
$ composer
```



Mac OS X
--------

For Mac users it's suggested to install the Composer using [Homebrew |http://brew.sh/]

```shell
$ brew install composer
```

It's possible, that you don't have installed PHP you system, so before installing Composer, you should install it by

```shell
$ brew install php@7.2
$ pecl install xdebug
```

Now you should be able to run Composer command in console

```shell
$ composer
```

If for some reason, you cannot use Homebrew, or you don't want to, install the Composer [like a Linux user would do |#linux].



Windows
-------

It's suggested to use the [installer |https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe], which you can get [in the download section of Composer website |https://getcomposer.org/download/].



Configuration
=============

Composer is closely integrated with version control tool [Git |http://git-scm.com]. If you do not use Git, it is necessary to tell it to Composer:

```shell
composer -g config preferred-install dist
```


Creating New Project
====================

New Nette project can be created by executing a simple command

```shell
composer create-project nette/sandbox name-of-the-project
```

Instead the `name-of-the-project` you should provide appropriate name and execute the command. Composer will fetch the `nette/sandbox` repository from GitHub and, right after that, install the `nette/nette` package, which is Nette Framework itself. The only thing which remains is to check write permissions on directories `temp/` and `log/` and you're ready to go.



Packagist.org - Global Repository
=================================

[Packagist |http://packagist.org] is the main package repository, in which Composer tries to search packages, if not told otherwise. You can also publish your own packages here, [just like Nette did |http://packagist.org/packages/nette/].

The easiest way to publish a package is to upload it on [GitHub |https://github.com] using [Git |http://git-scm.com/] and to paste url of the resulting repository into Packagist. More detailed description about creating a new package is in following paragraphs.


Usage
=====

The starting point for every project or library which uses Composer is `composer.json` file, which defines meta information and dependencies of your project.

The simplest `composer.json` can look like this:

```js
{
	"require": {
		"php": ">=7.1.1",
		"nette/nette": "~3.0.0"
	}
}
```

We're saying here, that our application (or library) depends on package `nette/nette` and it wants the newest version, that matches the `~3.0.0` version constraint and also that it will only run on PHP higher or equal to `7.1.1`.

So, when we have the `composer.json` file in the project root and we run

```shell
composer update
```

Composer will download the Nette Framework, and will put it into directory `vendor/nette/nette`.

.[note]
If you're using latest `nette/sandbox`, everything mentioned until here is already in place and you don't need to do it yourself.


Lock File
---------

When you run `composer update`, Composer creates `composer.lock` file right next to `composer.json`. This file contains metadata about packages and versions which are really installed.

It's standard that we commit `composer.lock` file only into concrete applications and not into libraries. There can be a situation, when a newer version of some our dependency is released, and our colleague will pull the latest version of our application, calls the `composer install` and now he has newer version of that library. The lock file prevents this because when you run the `install` and not `update`, the Composer will always install versions exactly as they are in the lock file.

.[note]
If we want to update the dependencies to newer ones, it's simple as calling `composer update`.


What If We Don't Want the Central Repository
--------------------------------------------

If we have internal applications or libraries in our company, which cannot be hosted publicly on GitHub and Packagist, we can create our own repositories for those project.

Nette Framework is always available publicly thanks to the central repository, but let's use it for demonstration purposes and assume we don't want to have it publicly available. You can put any path or address into `url`; it shall point to a git, mercurial or svn repository.

```js
{
	"repositories": [
		{
			"type": "vcs",
			"url": "git://github.com/nette/nette.git"
		}
	],
	"require": {
		"nette/nette": "~3.0.0",
	}
}
```

.[note]
More on repositories in [the official documentation |http://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#repositories].


What If We Have Our Project Already Running?
--------------------------------------------

Don't consider it a disadvantage, but a possibility of improving the whole project. Composer is not capable of installing *only some* dependencies -- it has to take care of all of them.

The recommended way is to create a `composer.json` file, list all dependencies your project have, install them via Composer and then delete the old and manually downloaded libraries in `libs/`.


Our Own Packages
================

Any project, which has `composer.json` in its root, can work as a Composer package. If it needs to work as a dependency, it needs to have defined at least two fields: `name` and `version`.

```js
{
	"name": "MyName/Blog",
	"description": "The Super Cool Blog.com",
	"version": "1.0.0"
}
```

.[note]
The name consists of a vendor name and concrete package name -- it shall prevent conflicts.

.[tip]
If we use a Version Control System (e.g. git), it is not necessary to specify the version parameter. Composer can detect [tags |http://getcomposer.org/doc/02-libraries.md#tags] and [branches |http://getcomposer.org/doc/02-libraries.md#branches] from git and those one, which look like version numbers, can be automatically used as dependencies.



Autoloading
-----------

Composer solves the autoloading problem automatically so you don't need to focus on it anymore. Each library can provide in its `composer.json` the autoloading standard it uses and Composer will take care of it. If we use PSR-0, our top-most namespace is `MyApp` and the code is located in `libs/` directory, then the autoloading part can look like:

```js
{
	"autoload": {
		"psr-0": {"MyApp": "libs/"},
	}
}
```

But what if our codebase doesn't comply to PSR-0 standard? No problem. We can specify `classmap` instead of `psr-0`, which is an equivalent of Nette's [RobotLoader |robotloader].

```js
{
	"autoload": {
		"classmap": ["src/", "lib/"]
	}
}
```

Composer will process autoloading sections from all libraries in the project, combine them and will create a single autoloader. All libraries, which specified autoloading, will now be autoloaded automatically.

Composer can also generate classmap via command `composer dump-autoload -o`.
