Upgrading
*********


Migrating from 3.x to 4.0
=========================

Minimum required PHP version is 8.0.

The `Nette\Utils\Reflection` class provided methods `getParameterType()`, `getPropertyType()` and `getReturnType()` for working with the types. These methods were created when PHP didn't have union, intersection or the newest disjunctive normal form types, which they no longer work with and were replaced by the [Type class |utils:type]. As of version 4.0, these methods have been removed.

The method `Nette\Utils\Reflection::getParameterDefaultValue()` is deprecated because the native `ReflectionParameter::getDefaultValue()` already works correctly.

The `Nette\Utils\Html::$xhtml` variable is removed.


Finder
------

Finder has moved to the `nette/utils` package, remove the original package:

```shell
composer remove nette/finder
```

On Linux, it now behaves in case-sensitive mode.

In the previous version, the `exclude()` and `filter()` methods worked differently when called **before** `from()` and `in()` respectively, and **after** it. This is no longer the case, `exclude()` and `filter()` always work the same. The former `filter()` called *before* has been replaced by the new `descentFilter()` method.

The Finder no longer implements the Countable interface.

A string starting with a slash in `Finder::findFiles('/f*')` is now considered an absolute path, it should be replaced with e.g. `Finder::findFiles('./f*')`.
