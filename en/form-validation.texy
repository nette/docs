Form Validation
***************


Required Controls
=================

Controls are marked as required with the method `setRequired()`, whose argument is the text of the [error message|#Error Messages] that will be displayed if the user does not fill it. If no argument is given, the default error message is used.

```php
$form->addText('name', 'Name:')
	->setRequired('Please fill your name.');
```


Rules
=====

We add validation rules to controls with the `addRule()` method. The first parameter is the rule, the second is the [error message|#Error Messages], and the third is the validation rule argument.

```php
$form->addPassword('password', 'Password:')
	->addRule($form::MIN_LENGTH, 'Password must be at least %d characters', 8)
```

Nette comes with a number of built-in rules whose names are constants of the `Nette\Forms\Form` class:

We can use the following rules for all controls:

| constant | description | arguments
|-------
| `REQUIRED` | alias of `setRequired()`  | -
| `FILLED` | alias of `setRequired()`  | -
| `BLANK` | must not be filled  | -
| `EQUAL` | value is equal to parameter  | `mixed`
| `NOT_EQUAL` | value is not be equal to parameter  | `mixed`
| `IS_IN` | value is equal to some element in the array | `array`
| `IS_NOT_IN` | value does not equal any element in the array | `array`
| `VALID` | input passes validation (for [#conditions])  | -

For controls `addText()`, `addPassword()`, `addTextArea()`, `addEmail()`, `addInteger()` the following rules can also be used:

| `MIN_LENGTH` | minimal string length | `int`
| `MAX_LENGTH` | maximal string length | `int`
| `LENGTH` | length in range or exact length | pair `[int, int]` or `int`
| `EMAIL` | valid email address | -
| `URL` | valid URL | -
| `PATTERN` | matches regular pattern | `string`
| `PATTERN_ICASE` | like `PATTERN`, but case-insensitive | `string`
| `INTEGER` | integer | -
| `NUMERIC` | alias of `INTEGER` | -
| `FLOAT` | integer or floating point number | -
| `MIN` | minimum of the integer value | `int\|float`
| `MAX` | maximum of the integer value | `int\|float`
| `RANGE` | value in the range | pair `[int\|float, int\|float]`

The `INTEGER`, `NUMERIC` a `FLOAT` rules automatically convert the value to integer (or float respectively). Furthermore, the `URL` rule also accepts an address without a schema (eg `nette.org`) and completes the schema (`http://nette.org`).
The expressions in `PATTERN` and `PATTERN_ICASE` must be valid for the whole value, ie as if it were wrapped in the characters `^` and `$`.

For controls `addUpload()`, `addMultiUpload()` the following rules can also be used:

| `MAX_FILE_SIZE` | maximal file size | `int`
| `MIME_TYPE` | MIME type, accepts wildcards (`'video/*'`) | `string\|string[]`
| `IMAGE` | uploaded file is JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP | -
| `PATTERN` | file name matches regular expression | `string`
| `PATTERN_ICASE` | like `PATTERN`, but case-insensitive | `string`

The `MIME_TYPE` and `IMAGE` require PHP extension `fileinfo`. Whether a file or image is of the required type is detected by its signature. The integrity of the entire file is not checked. You can find out if an image is not corrupted for example by trying to [load it|http-request-response#toImage].

For controls `addMultiUpload()`, `addCheckboxList()`, `addMultiSelect()` the following rules can also be used to limit the number of selected items, respectively uploaded files:

| `MIN_LENGTH` | minimal count | `int`
| `MAX_LENGTH` | maximal count | `int`
| `LENGTH` | count in range or exact count | pair `[int, int]` or `int`


Error Messages
--------------

All predefined rules except `PATTERN` and `PATTERN_ICASE` have a default error message, so they it be omitted. However, by passing and formulating all customized messages, you will make the form more user-friendly.

You can change the default messages in [configuration |configuring#forms], by modifing the texts in the `Nette\Forms\Validator::$messages` array or by using [translator|translations#Forms translation].

The following wildcards can be used in the text of error messages:

| `%d`     | gradually replaces the rules after the arguments
| `%n$d`   | replaces with the nth rule argument
| `%label` | replaces with field label (without colon)
| `%name`  | replaces with field name (eg `name`)
| `%value` | replaces with value entered by the user

```php
$form->addText('name', 'Name:')
	->setRequired('Please fill in %label');

$form->addInteger('id', 'ID:')
	->addRule($form::RANGE, 'at least %d and no more than %d', [5, 10]);

$form->addInteger('id', 'ID:')
	->addRule($form::RANGE, 'no more than %2$d and at least %1$d', [5, 10]);
```


Conditions
==========

Besides validation rules, conditions can be set. They are set much like rules, yet we use `addRule()` instead of `addCondition()` and of course, we leave it without an error message (the condition just asks):

```php
$form->addPassword('password', 'Password:')
	// if password is not longer than 8 characters ...
	->addCondition($form::MAX_LENGTH, 8)
		// ... then it must contain a number
		->addRule($form::PATTERN, 'Must contain number', '.*[0-9].*');
```

Condition can be linked to a different element than the current one using `addConditionOn()`. The first parameter is a reference to the field. In the following case, the email will only be required if the checkbox is checked (ie. its value is `true`):

```php
$form->addCheckbox('newsletters', 'send me newsletters');

$form->addEmail('email', 'Email:')
	// if checkbox is checked ...
	->addConditionOn($form['newsletters'], $form::EQUAL, true)
		// ... require email
		->setRequired('Fill your email address');
```

Conditions can be grouped into complex structures with `elseCondition()` and `endCondition()` methods.

```php
$form->addText(...)
	->addCondition(...) // if the first condition is met
		->addConditionOn(...) // and the second condition on another element too
			->addRule(...) // require this rule
		->elseCondition() // if the second condition is not met
			->addRule(...) // require these rules
			->addRule(...)
		->endCondition() // we return to the first condition
		->addRule(...)
```


References Between Controls
===========================

The rule or condition argument can be a reference to another element. For example, you can dynamically validate that the `text` has as many characters as the value of the `length` field is:

```php
$form->addInteger('length');
$form->addText('text')
	->addRule($form::LENGTH, null, $form['length']);
```


Custom Rules
============

We can create our own rules or conditions. As a rule, we pass any PHP callback.

```php
class MyValidators
{
	// tests whether the value is divisible by an argument
	public static function divisibilityValidator(BaseControl $input, $arg): bool
	{
		return $input->getValue() % $arg === 0;
	}
}

$input->addRule(
	'MyValidator::divisibilityValidator',
	'Number must be multiple of %d',
	8
);
```


Modifying Input Values
======================

Using the `addFilter()` method, we can modify the value entered by the user. In this example, we will tolerate and remove spaces in the zip code:

```php
$form->addText('zip', 'Postcode:')
	->addFilter(function ($value) {
		return str_replace(' ', '', $value); // remove spaces from the postcode
	})
	->addRule($form::PATTERN, 'The postal code is not five digits', '\d{5}');
```

The filter is included between the validation rules and conditions and therefore depends on the order of the methods, ie the filter and the rule are called in the same order as is the order of the `addFilter()` and `addRule()` methods.


JavaScript
==========

The language of validation rules and conditions is powerful. Even though all constructions work both server-side and client-side, in JavaScript. Rules are transferred in HTML attributes `data-nette-rules` as JSON.
The validation itself is handled by another script, which hooks all form's `submit` events, iterates over all inputs and runs respective validations.

This script is `netteForms.js`, which is available from several possible sources:

You can embed the script directly into the HTML page from the CDN:

```html
<script src="https://nette.github.io/resources/js/3/netteForms.min.js"></script>
```

Or copy locally to the public folder of the project (e.g. from `vendor/nette/forms/src/assets/netteForms.min.js`):

```html
<script src="/path/to/netteForms.min.js"></script>
```

Or install via [npm|https://www.npmjs.com/package/nette-forms]:

```bash
npm install nette-forms
```

And then load and run:

```js
import netteForms from 'nette-forms';
netteForms.initOnLoad();
```

Alternatively, you can load it directly from the folder `vendor`:

```js
import netteForms from '../path/to/vendor/nette/forms/src/assets/netteForms.js';
netteForms.initOnLoad();
```


Custom Rules in JS
------------------

Custom validation rules can also be added to JavaScript. The condition is that the callback of the custom rule on the PHP side is a global function or a static method. Then we add its JavaScript equivalent to the JS object `Nette.validators`:

```html
<script>
Nette.validators.divisibilityValidator = function(elem, args, val) {
	return val % args === 0;
};
</script>
```

If PHP validation callback is a static method, we derive the name for JavaScript by removing all backslashes `\` and by replacing the double colon by single underscore `_`, e.g. `App\MyValidator::divisibilityValidator` is converted to `AppMyValidator_divisibilityValidator`.


Disabling Validation
====================

In certain cases, you need to disable validation. If a submit button isn't supposed to run validation after submitting (for example *Cancel* or *Preview* button), you can disable the validation by calling `$submit->setValidationScope([])`. You can also validate the form partially by specifying items to be validated.

```php
$form->addText('name')
	->setRequired();

$details = $form->addContainer('details');
$details->addInteger('age')
	->setRequired('age');
$details->addInteger('age2')
	->setRequired('age2');

$form->addSubmit('send1'); // Validates the whole form
$form->addSubmit('send2')
	->setValidationScope([]); // Validates nothing
$form->addSubmit('send3')
	->setValidationScope([$form['name']]); // Validates only 'name' field
$form->addSubmit('send4')
	->setValidationScope([$form['details']['age']]); // Validates only 'age' field
$form->addSubmit('send5')
	->setValidationScope([$form['details']]); // Validates 'details' container
```

[#Event onValidate] on the form is always invoked and is not affected by the `setValidationScope`. `onValidate` event on the container is invoked only when this container is specified for partial validation.


Postprocessing Errors
=====================

We often find that the user's input is wrong even though each of the form's controls is technically valid. For example, stumbling upon a duplicate key when inserting a new database row. Or invalid login credentials. In that case, we can add the error manually with `addError()` method. It can be called either on a specific input or on a form itself:

```php
try {
	$values = $form->getValues();
	$this->user->login($values->username, $values->password);
	$this->redirect('Homepage:');

} catch (Nette\Security\AuthenticationException $e) {
	if ($e->getCode() === Nette\Security\Authenticator::INVALID_CREDENTIAL) {
		$form->addError('Invalid password.');
	}
}
```

It's recommended to link the error directly to a form element because then the error will be displayed next to it when using default renderer.

```php
$form['date']->addError("We apologize but this date has been already taken.");
```

You can call `addError()` repeatedly to add multiple error messages to form or field. You can get them with `getErrors()`.

Note that `$form->getErrors()` returns a summary of all error messages, even those that were added directly to individual controls, not just the form. You can get error messages passed directly to the form via `$form->getOwnErrors()`.


Event onValidate
================

Validation raises the `onValidate` [event|glossary#Events], the handler of which can be used for additional validation, typically to verify the correct combination of values in multiple form controls:

```php
protected function createComponentSignInForm(): Form
{
	$form = new Form;
	...
	$form->onValidate[] = [$this, 'validateSignInForm'];
	return $form;
}

public function validateSignInForm(Form $form): void
{
	$values = $form->getValues();

	if (...) { // validation logic
		$form->addError('Password does not match.');
	}
}
```

You can bind multiple functions to the event. The function is considered successful if it doesn't add any error using `$form->addError()`.
