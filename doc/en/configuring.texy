System container is a DI container holding all the services and parameters needed for the application to run.
Soon you will be able to:

- create the system container
- configure your application using NEON files
- handle production and development modes
- create and use your own container extensions
\--

*This page is still being prepared*

System container is a static [Dependency Injection container |dependency-injection#toc-nette-di-container], that holds all services and parameters the application needs. This means not only services of the framework itself, but of each library you have decided to use. Take a look at an example of such [system container |configuring/systemcontainer].

Developers learned that writing containers is a very tedious work. And it surely gets difficult to manage the application as it grows. Nette will do the work for you! With a simple configuration language we will describe services of the application and the framework will generate the PHP code. In all seriousness - the container linked above was generated this way as well.


Configurator
************

The task of code generation is given to [Nette\Config\Configurator|api:] class. The compilation process is triggered only once and its result cached. For that reason we need to choose a directory for storing this code.

/--php
$configurator = new Nette\Config\Configurator;
$configurator->setTempDirectory(__DIR__ . '/../temp');
\--

Now we just add a path to the config file:

/--php
$configurator->addConfig(__DIR__ . '/config/config.neon');
\--

And getting container's instance is the simplest one:

/--php
// return object of class SystemContainer
$container = $configurator->createContainer();
\--


Running in different modes
==========================

Configurator attempts to detect if the application is running on production or development server. As long as the server's IP address is 127.0.0.1 it is considered as in development mode. Get the current mode using `isProductionMode()` method and change it using `setProductionMode()`.


RobotLoader
===========

To compile the container Configurator needs to load all the classes mentioned in configuration files. It is most handy to have auto-loading at your disposal and Configurator offers a method creating an instance of RobotLoader. We only list the directories to be indexed and activate the loader. Do not forget to place this code before calling `createContainer()`.

/--php
$configurator->createRobotLoader()
	->addDirectory(APP_DIR)
	->addDirectory(LIBS_DIR)
	->register();
\--


Configuration using NEON files
******************************

Have fun trying out the syntax at http://ne-on.org.


Services definitions
====================

/--code neon
services:
	database:
		class: Nette\Database\Connection(%dsn%, %user%, %password%)

#or in two lines
		class: Nette\Database\Connection
		arguments: [%dsn%, %user%, %password%]

\--

Generates:

/--php
	function createServiceDatabase()
	{
		return new Nette\Database\Connection(
			$this->parameters['dsn'],
			$this->parameters['user'],
			$this->parameters['password']
		);
	}
\--


Service definition:

/--code neon
services:
	database:
		class: Nette\Database\Connection
		factory: DbFactory::createConnection

\--

`DbFactory::createConnection`:

/--php
class DbFactory
{
	static function createConnection(Nette\DI\Container $container)
	{
		...
	}
}
\--

Generates:

/--php
	function createServiceDatabase()
	{
		return DbFactory::createConnection($this);
	}
\--




Setup
=====

/--code neon
services:
	database:
		class: Nette\Database\Connection(%dsn%, %user%, %password%)
		setup:
			- setCacheStorage(@cacheStorage)

\--

Generates:

/--php
	function createServiceDatabase()
	{
		$service = new Nette\Database\Connection(...);
		$service->setCacheStorage($this->cacheStorage);
		return $service;
	}
\--

Autowiring feature adds dependencies automatically, so they don't even have to be mentioned:

/--code neon
setup:
	- setCacheStorage
\--

In case the `cacheStorage` service does not exist, it is possible to use a result of a call as a parameter:

/--code neon
setup:
	- setCacheStorage( Factory::createStorage() )

# or a method of other service:
	- setCacheStorage( @factory::createStorage() )
\--

Alternatively a newly created class instance:

/--code neon
setup:
	- setCacheStorage( Nette\Caching\Storages\FileStorage(%tempDir%) )

# generates: $service->setCacheStorage(new Nette\Caching\Storages\FileStorage(...));
\--

You can also set a value of a property:

substitutions
/--code neon
setup:
	- $substitutions( [db: test] )

# generates: $service->substitutions = array('db' => 'test');
\--


Full example:

/--code neon
parameters:
	database:
		driver: mysql
		host: localhost
		dbname: test
		user: jim
		password: beam
		substitutions:
			db: test

services:
	database:
		class: Nette\Database\Connection(
			'%database.driver%:host=%database.host%;dbname=%database.dbname%',
			%database.user%, %database.password%, null,
			Nette\Database\Reflection\DiscoveredReflection()
		)
		setup:
			- setCacheStorage
			- $substitutions( %database.substitutions% )

\--


Service definitions inheritance
===============================

/--code neon
services:
	dev_database < database
		setup:
			- Diagnostics\ConnectionPanel::initialize

\--


Factories
=========

Factories are defined in almost the same way as services:

/--code neon
factories:
	article:
		class: Article
\--

Generates:

/--php
	function createArticle()
	{
		return new Article($this->database);
	}
\--

Factory is called directly like `$article = $container->createArticle();`

Unlike services a factory can accept parameters:

/--code neon
factories:
	article:
		parameters: [id, title: null]
		class: Article(..., %id%)
		setup:
			- $title(%title%)

\--

Generates:

/--php
	function createArticle($id, $title = NULL)
	{
		$service = new Article($this->database, $id);
		$service->title = $title;
		return $service;
	}
\--



Auto-wiring
***********

Auto-wiring feature can automatically pass dependencies into constructor and methods of the service. It uses typehinting and `@return` annotations. There can be only one service matching the type in the container, otherwise an exception is thrown.

To define more than one service of the same type we need to exclude them from auto-wiring:

/--code neon
services:
	cacheStorage:
		class: Nette\Caching\Storages\FileStorage(%tempDir%)

	tempCacheStorage:
		class: Nette\Caching\Storages\DevNullStorage
		autowired: no

\--


When modifying the Nette Framework's core services we need to make sure the container is aware of the classes we want to use. That means using fully qualified class names in `@return` annotations or set the FQ class name with `class` entry.


Multiple configuration files
****************************

Use `includes` section to add more configuration files.

/--code neon
includes:
	- parameters.php
	- services.neon
	- presenters.neon
\--

Configuration merging process assigns the highest priority to the file containing `includes` section and the lowest priority to the first included file. To prevent merging of a certain array use exclamation mark right after the name of the array:

/--code neon
argument!: [1, 2, 3]
\--


Container extensions
********************

`Configurator` does not generate the code itself, that is the task of [Nette\Config\Compiler|api:] and [Nette\DI\ContainerBuilder|api:] classes. [Nette\Config\Loader|api:] starts first and loads the configuration files and passes them to `Compiler`. Add your own extension to `Compiler` as shown below:

/---code php
$configurator->onCompile[] = function ($configurator, $compiler) {
	$compiler->addExtension('blog', new MyBlogExtension);
};
\---

Each `Compiler` extension must extend [Nette\Config\CompilerExtension|api:] and can implement three different methods that are called successively during the `Container` compilation.


CompilerExtension::loadConfiguration() .{toc: loadConfiguration()}
==================================================================

This method is called first and loads additional configuration files, creates methods using [Nette\DI\ContainerBuilder|api:] and most importantly processes the application's configuration.

Config can contain a section bearing the same name as your extension. Using the last example, following lines can appear in your config file:

/--code neon
blog: # same name as your extension
	postsPerPage: 10
	comments: FALSE
\--

Use [getConfig() |api:Nette\Config\CompilerExtension::getConfig()] method in the extension to list its configuration.

/--code php
class MyBlogExtension extends Nette\Config\CompilerExtension
{
	public function loadConfiguration()
	{
		$config = $this->getConfig();
		// array(2) [ 'postsPerPage' => 10, 'comments' => FALSE ]
\--

Honoring the "convention over configuration":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration principle we can set default values and be able to use the application without explicitly setting anything. First argument of `getConfig()` accepts an array of default values, into which the config section (as mentioned above) will be merged.

/--code php
class MyBlogExtension extends Nette\Config\CompilerExtension
{
	public $defaults = array(
		'postsPerPage' => 5,
		'comments' => TRUE
	);

	public function loadConfiguration()
	{
		$config = $this->getConfig($this->defaults);
\--

Now we have the configuration in the `$config` array and can use it while creating the services. `ContainerBuilder` class allows you to use the same way of service description as NEON used in the configuration files.

/--code php
$builder = $this->getContainerBuilder();
\--

Create `blog_articles` service representing a model for handling and loading articles.

.[tip]
Convention is to prefix services by their name to avoid conflicts. Using `prefix()` method we can then access the service via `$container->blog->articles` instead of `$container->blog_articles`.

/--code php
$builder->addDefinition($this->prefix('articles'))
	->setClass('MyBlog\ArticlesModel', array('@connection'));
\--

You can also create a component factory, pass it `blog_articles` service and set a number of posts per page option. How to use component factories will be shown soon.

/--code php
$builder->addDefinition($this->prefix('articlesList'))
	->setClass('MyBlog\Components\ArticlesList', array($this->prefix('@articles')))
	->addSetup('setPostsPerPage', $config['postsPerPage'])
	->setShared(FALSE)->setAutowired(FALSE); // turns service into factory
\--

We will also need a `blog_comment` class and pass it connection to database and `blog_articles` instance. If the comments are disabled we can reflect it using `addSetup` method:

/--code php
$comments = $builder->addDefinition($this->prefix('comments'))
	->setClass('MyBlog\CommentsModel', array('@connection', $this->prefix('@articles')));

if (!$config['comments']) { // optional disabling of commenting
	$comments->addSetup('disableComments');
}
\--

Of course comments needs to be written and shown, so we add one more component factory - `blog_commentsControl`, that will allow us to list comments and to post new ones, unless they have been closed.

/--code php
$builder->addDefinition($this->prefix('commentsControl'))
	->setClass('MyBlog\Components\CommentsControl', array($this->prefix('@comments')))
	->setShared(FALSE)->setAutowired(FALSE); // turns service into factory
\--

.[note]
This division into models and components is purely illustrative.


Loading additional configurations
---------------------------------

If you prefer configuration files over extensions, you can move some of the definitions into separate configuration file.

/--code neon
services:
	blog_articles:
		class: MyBlog\ArticlesModel(@connection)

	blog_comments:
		class: MyBlog\CommentsModel(@connection, @blog_articles)

factories:
	blog_articlesList:
		class: MyBlog\Components\ArticlesList(@blog_articles)

	blog_commentsControl:
		class: MyBlog\Components\CommentsControl(@blog_comments)
\--

Load the file and set additional services

/--code php
public function loadConfiguration()
{
	$config = $this->getConfig($this->defaults);
	$builder = $this->getContainerBuilder();

	// load additional config file for this extension
	$this->compiler->parseServices($builder, $this->loadFromFile(__DIR__ . '/blog.neon'));

	// set a number of articles per page in the component
	$builder->getDefinition('blog_articlesList')
		->addSetup('setPostsPerPage', $config['postsPerPage']);

	// optional disabling of commenting
	if (!$config['comments']) {
		$builder->getDefinition('blog_comments')
			->addSetup('disableComments');
	}
}
\--

Thanks to NEON syntax you now have cleaner container extension.


CompilerExtension::beforeCompile() .{toc: beforeCompile()}
==========================================================

In `beforeCompile` phase we should not add any more services, however you can modify already existing ones or add relations between services (for example using tags).


CompilerExtension::afterCompile(Nette\Utils\PhpGenerator\ClassType $class) .{toc: afterCompile()}
=================================================================================================

In this phase the `Container` instance is already generated and contains all service methods and is ready to be stored into cache. Thanks to [Nette\Utils\PhpGenerator\ClassType |api:] you can add your own code to the container to modify the service generation.

To inspire yourself take a look at Nette Framework's `initialize` method, which Nette adds to process [some of the user settings |api:Nette\Config\Extensions\NetteExtension::afterCompile()]. This method is always called after instantiation of the container.

Here is a piece of code of `initialize` where Nette adds a session start and autorun of services marked with `run` tag.

/--code php
public function afterCompile(Nette\Utils\PhpGenerator\ClassType $class)
{
	$container = $this->getContainerBuilder();
	$config = $this->getConfig($this->defaults);

	// initialize method
	$initialize = $class->methods['initialize'];

	// automatic session start
	if ($config['session']['autoStart']) {
		$initialize->addBody('$this->session->start();');
	}

	// services with run tag must be run after instantition of the container
	foreach ($container->findByTag('run') as $name => $foo) {
		$initialize->addBody('$this->getService(?);', array($name));
	}
}
\--

Methods' `beforeCompile()` and `afterCompile()` difference is that `beforeCompile()` has access to container and services while `afterCompile()` accesses its code (via "Nette\Utils\PhpGenerator":http://api.nette.org/2.0/namespace-Nette.Utils.PhpGenerator.html).
