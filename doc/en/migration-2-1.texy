Backward Incompatible Changes
=============================

Database (NDB)
--------------

- `Nette\Database\Connection` is not a descendant of `PDO`:http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.pdo.php
- rename methods `exec()` -> `query()`, `fetchColumn()` -> `fetchField()` and `lastInsertId()` -> `getInsertId()`
- `Nette\Database\Statement` rename to `Nette\Database\ResultSet`, which is not a descendant of `PDOStatement`:http://www.php.net/manual/en/class.pdostatement.php
- rename methods `rowCount()` -> `getRowCount()` and `columnCount()` -> `getColumnCount()`
- MySQL: removed timezone setting. Use onConnect[] event instead. ("commit":https://github.com/nette/nette/commit/61c9d9f1c254334e82b9388cdc95d3256e6fd71e)

Are you using Nette Database Table (NDBT), a great part of the NDB to which is accessed via `$database->table(...)`?

- method `table()` was moved from `Connection` to new class `Nette\Database\Context`. It "contains":https://api.nette.org/2.1/Nette.Database.Context.html all of the important methods for working with databases, so feel free to change the `Connection` for `Context` and you're done.
- properties of `ActiveRow` are now read-only, for updating use `$row->update(array('field' => 'value'))`. The old behavior had so many difficulties, sorry.
- backjoin syntax was changed from `book_tag:tag.name` to `:book_tag.tag.name` (see semicolons)
- instead of second argument `$having` in method `group()` use method `having()`
- Selection: removed support for INNER join in where statement ("commit":https://github.com/nette/nette/commit/68314840e2429351d1e37e00c6070a21bdc36744)


Dependency Injection (DI)
-------------------------

- class `Nette\Config\Configurator` -> `Nette\Configurator`
- definitions of factories and services in configuration file were merged into a single `services` section. Append key `autowired: no` to the factories when moving them to `services` section.
- introduced "bullet" syntax for anonymous services:

/--neon
services:
	Namespace\Class: self  # old way

	- Namespace\Class  # new way
\--

Working directly with the DI container is usually not a good idea, but if you do so:
- factory method call as `$container->createService('name')` instead of `$container->createName()`
- all default factories are deprecated: `createLatte()`, `createCache()`, `createMail()` a `createBasicForm()`
- access to services via `$container->getService()` or `getByType()` instead of `$container->serviceName`
- Container: removed property `$classes`, removed parameter `$meta` in method `addService()`
- ServiceDefinition: removed property `$internal` and method `setInternal()`
- ContainerBuilder: method `generateClass()` is deprecated, use `generateClasses()[0]` instead
- ContainerBuilder operates on expanded parameters, removed `Helpers: escape()`
- Configurator: deprecated parameter `productionMode`, use `debugMode` instead
- Configurator: methods `setProductionMode`, `isProductionMode` and `detectProductionMode` are deprecated, use `*Debug*` variants instead
- Container: removed deprecated property `$params`, use `$parameters` instead

If you write your own extensions, you should know that these namespaces was renamed: `Nette\Config` -> `Nette\DI` and `Nette\Utils\PhpGenerator` -> `Nette\PhpGenerator`.

Compared to the dev-version the annotation `@inject` a methods `inject()` are processed automatically only for presenters. They can be enabled using key `inject: yes` in the definition.

If you are using old `Environment`, it will require to set constant `TEMP_DIR`.


Application & Presenter
-----------------------
- Presenter doesn't accept array in persistent parameters anymore. If you really do want to use arrays, assign empty array as default value.
- deprecated all of the following methods: `getService()` (use `getContext()->getService()`), `getHttpContext()` and `getApplication()`
- magical `getParameter(null)` -> `getParameters()`
- you can use `redrawControl()` instead of `invalidateControl()`
- Application: methods `storeRequest()` and `restoreRequest()` are deprecated, call them on `UI\Presenter` instead
- Application\Routers\Route: foo-parameters are not optional when pattern is missing


Latte
-----
- default mode is HTML (instead of XHTML); if you need to use XHTML, please see "configuration":https://doc.nette.org/cs/2.1/configuring#toc-sablony
- automatic quoting of attributes in `<a title={$title}>`; this should not cause any trouble, but it's better to mention it just in case
- renamed`n:input` to `n:name`; it can be used on tags other than `<input>`, like label, select, form and textarea
- deprecated `{attr}` (replaced by `n:attr`) and `{assign}` -> `{var}`
- it's now best practise to use `{$var|noescape}` instead of old "exclamation mark" notation `{!$var}`, it's more clearer
- shorter macro for blocks `{#block}` (present in development version) was not included in version 2.1 due to comprehension reasons
- native support for empty macros, use for example `{label foo /}` instead of `{label foo}`

Latte contains a new feature which automatically checks if variable `$url` in `<a href={$url}>` contains malicious code (like `javascript:siteHack()`). It only allows http, https, ftp, mailto protocols and relative paths. It also checks in attributes src, action, formaction and `<object data=...>`. Should you need to print URL without checking, use `|nosafeurl` modifier.

There also was a small change with manual rendering of checkboxes, which is described later in the article.


Forms
-----
Checkboxes and RadioLists are now rendered in more practical way (`<label><input>...</label>` instead of `<label>...</label><input>`). Therefore, Checkbox's method `getLabel()` or `{label}` return nothing and `getControl()` or `{input}` return HTML in the new form. Should you need previous behavior, you can achieve it by so-called partial rendering by adding colon (`{label elementName:}` and `{input elementName:}`). Easy.

Macro `{control form}` always prints error messages next to controls; only unassigned errors are shown in the beginning of the form. It is recommended to do it like this when rendering form manually, "as can be seen in the example":https://github.com/nette/sandbox/blob/f1819483da6467af1706fbc6b5679aa2f79aa8d0/app/templates/components/form.latte.

- `setValue()` checks value and throws exception if something is wrong (instead of ignoring any errors)
- validation rules `Form::INTEGER`, `NUMERIC` and `FLOAT` cast the value to integer or float
- TextArea: removed default values of attributes `cols` and `rows` (they were included only because HTML4 required them)
- controls marked `setDisabled()` are not present in `$form->getValues()` (they are not sent by the browser)
- deprecated `SelectBox::setPrompt(true)`; use string instead of true
- renamed `MultiSelectBox::getSelectedItem()` -> `getSelectedItems()`
- HTML attributes as `data-nette-rules` contains JSON, don't forget to update `netteForms.js` to latest version
- Form: removed deprecated event `$onInvalidSubmit`, use `$onError` instead
- RadioList: calling `getValue(true)` is deprecated, use `getRawValue()` instead

Debugger
--------
- `Nette\Diagnostics\Debugger::$blueScreen` -> `Debugger::getBlueScreen()`
- and similarly `$bar` -> `getBar()`, `$logger` -> `getLogger()` a `$fireLogger` -> `getFireLogger()`
- deprecated `Nette\Diagnostics\Debugger::tryError()`, `catchError()` and also `toStringException()`, use standard `trigger_error()` instead
- deprecated internal `Nette\Diagnostics\Helpers::clickableDump()` and `htmlDump()`, which were replaced by `Dumper`


Mail
----
- Deprecated method `Nette\Mail\Message::send()`, use mailer, see "documentation":https://doc.nette.org/cs/2.1/mailing.
- Mail\Message: methods `setHtmlBody()` and `setBody()` render template immediately
- MimePart: removed method `generateMessage()`, use `getEncodedMessage()` instead


Miscellaneous
-------------
- Nette Framework dropped support for PHP 5.2; to ease migration to namespaces, `migration-53.php` utility is available
- minimized version is generated in "PHAR format":http://www.php.net/manual/en/book.phar.php, therefore there's `nette.phar` instead of `nette.min.php` in the distribution. Usage is the same.
- `Nette\Utils\Finder::find($mask)` filters both directories and files by mask
- `Nette\Security\User` accepts authenticator in constructor, beware of circular dependencies
- loader doesn't set `iconv_set_encoding()` and `mb_internal_encoding()` anymore
- deprecated constants `NETTE, NETTE_DIR and NETTE_VERSION_ID`
- deprecated class `Nette\Loaders\AutoLoader`
- deprecated variable `Nette\Framework::$iAmUsingBadHost`
- we recommend you to stop using `callback()` and class `Nette\Callback`, because global functions can cause "troubles":https://github.com/nette/nette/issues/1187
- renamed namespace `Nette\Utils\PhpGenerator` -> `Nette\PhpGenerator`
- Nette shows warning â€žPossible problem: you are sending a cookie while already having some data in output buffer,â€œ if you are trying to send HTTP headers or cookies and previous output was sent to buffer. The error is shown because buffer may overflow.
- InstanceFilter: removed entirely
- RecursiveFilter: removed method `accept()` and parameter `$childrenCallback` in constructor
- RequestFactory: removed method `setEncoding()`, only UTF-8 and binary (via `setBinary()`) is now supported
- ObjectMixin: removed method `callProperty()`
- ObjectMixin: removes support for non-registered extension methods (`*_prototype_*` functions)
