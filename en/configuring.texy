Configuration
*************

.[perex]
An overview of all configuration options in the Nette Framework.

Nette application is easily configured using [configuration files |bootstrap#di-container-configuration]. They are usually written in **NEON format**, [see its syntax |https://ne-on.org#doc]. We recommend to use [editors with |editors-and-tools#ide-editor] support for this format for editing.

Application
===========

Basic settings for [Nette Application |application].

```neon
application:
	# shows "Nette Application" panel in Tracy BlueScreen?
	debugger: ...           # (bool) defaults to true

	# will error-presenter be called on error?
	catchExceptions: ...    # (bool) defaults to true in production mode

	# name of error-presenter
	errorPresenter: Error   # (string) defaults to 'Nette:Error'

	# do bad links generate warnings?
	# has effect only in developer mode
	silentLinks: ...        # (bool) defaults to false
```

Because error-presenters are not called by default in development mode and the errors are displayed by Tracy, changing the value `catchExceptions` to `true` helps to verify that error-presenters works correct during development.

Option `silentLinks` determines how Nette behaves in developer mode when link generation fails (for example, because there is no presenter, etc). The default value `false` means that Nette triggers `E_USER_WARNING`. Setting to `true` suppresses this error message. In a production environment, `E_USER_WARNING` is always invoked. We can also influence this behavior by setting the presenter variable [$invalidLinkMode |creating-links#Invalid Links].

Mapping
-------

Defines the rules according to which the name of the class (for example `App\Presenters\HomepagePresenter`) is derived from the name of the presenter (for example `Homepage`). This the mapping can be achieved with the following configuration:

```neon
application:
	mapping:
		*: App\Presenters\*Presenter
```

The presenter name is replaced with an asterisk and the result is the class name. Easy!

If we divide presenters into modules, we can have our own mapping for each module:

```neon
application:
	mapping:
		Front: App\FrontModule\*Presenter
		Admin: App\AdminModule\*Presenter
		Error: App\Error\*Presenter
```

Now presenter `Front:Homepage` maps to class `App\FrontModule\HomepagePresenter` and presenter `Admin:Dashboard` to class `App\AdminModule\DashboardPresenter`.

It will be more handy to create a general (asterisk) rule that will replace the first two rules and add an extra asterisk just for the module:

```neon
application:
	mapping:
		*: App\*Module\*Presenter
		Error: App\ModuleError\*Presenter
```

Again, the presenter `Front:Homepage` maps to the class `App\FrontModule\HomepagePresenter`.

But what if we use nested modules and have a presenter `Admin:User:Edit`? In this case, the segment with an asterisk representing the module for each level is simply repeated and the result is class `App\AdminModule\UserModule\EditPresenter`.

An alternative notation is to use an array consisting of three segments instead of a string:

```neon
application:
	mapping:
		*: [App, *Module, *Presenter]
```

Even in this case, the result will be class `App\AdminModule\UserModule\EditPresenter`.

The default value is `*: *Module\*Presenter`.


Automatic Registration of Presenters
------------------------------------

Nette automatically adds presenters as services to the DI container, which significantly speeds up their creation. How Nette finds out presenters can be configured:

```neon
application:
	# to look for presenters in Composer class map?
	scanComposer: ...      # (bool) defaults to true

	# what string must contain the class and file name?
	scanFilter: ...        # (string) defaults to 'Presenter'

	# in which directories to look for presenters?
	scanDirs:              # (string[]|false) defaults to '%appDir%'
		- %vendorDir%/mymodule
```

The directories listed in `scanDirs` do not override the default value `%appDir%`, but complement it, so `scanDirs` will contain both paths `%appDir%` and `%vendorDir%/mymodule`. If we want to overwrite the default directory, we use [exclamation mark |di-services#toc-multiple-configuration-files]:

```neon
application:
	scanDirs!:
		- %vendorDir%/mymodule
```

Directory scanning can be turned off by setting false. We do not recommend completely suppressing the automatic addition of presenters, otherwise application performance will be reduced.



Constants
=========

Creating PHP constants.

```neon
constants:
	FOOBAR: 'baz'
```

The `FOOBAR` constant will created after startup.


Database
========

The configuration for one or more database connections for [Nette Database |database].

```neon
database:
	# DSN, only mandatory key
	dsn: "sqlite:%appDir%/Model/demo.db"
	user: ...
	password: ...
```

It creates services of type `Nette\Database\Connection` and also `Nette\Database\Context` for the [Database Explorer] layer. The database connection is usually passed by autowiring, if this is not possible, use the service names `@database.default.connection` resp. `@database.default.context`.

Other settings:

```neon
database:
	# shows database panel in Tracy Bar?
	debugger: ...     # (bool) defaults to true

	# shows query EXPLAIN in Tracy Bar?
	explain: ...      # (bool) defaults to true

	# to enable autowiring for this connection?
	autowired: ...    # (bool) defaults to true for first connection

	# table conventions: discovered, static, or class name
	conventions: discovered  # (string) defaults to 'discovered'

	options:
		# to connect to the database only when needed?
		lazy: ...     # (bool) defaults to false

		# PHP database driver class
		driverClass:  # (string)

		# you can list the options found in the PDO driver documentation
		PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_COMPRESS: true
```

In the configuration file we can define more database connections by dividing them into named sections:

```neon
database:
	main:
		dsn: 'mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test'
		user: root
		password: password

	another:
		dsn: 'sqlite::memory:'
```

Each defined connection creates services that includes section name in their name, ie `@database.main.connection` & `@database.main.context` and further `@database.another.connection` & `@database.another.context`.

Autowiring is enabled only for services from the first section. This can be changed with `autowired: false` or `autowired: true`. Non-autowired services are passed by name:

```neon
services:
	- UserManager(@database.another.connection)
```


Decorator
=========

How to bulk edit all services of a certain type? Need to call a certain method for all presenters inheriting from a particular common ancestor? That's where the decorator comes from.

```neon
decorator:
	# for all services that are instances of this class or interface
	App\Presenters\BasePresenter:
		setup:
			- setProjectId(10)       # call this method
			- $absoluteUrls = true   # and set the variable
```

Decorator can also be used to set tags or turn on [inject |di-builtin-extensions#Inject Extension] mode.

```neon
decorator:
	InjectableInterface:
		tags: [mytag: 1]
		inject: true
```


DI
===

Technical settings of the DI container.

```neon
di:
	# shows DIC in Tracy Bar?
	debugger: ...        # (bool) defaults to true

	# parameter types that you never autowire
	excluded: ...        # (string[])

	# the class from which the DI container inherits
	parentClass: ...     # (string) defaults to Nette\DI\Container
```

A big part of the DI container class is metadata. You can shrink this class by disabling parameter passing if you're not using `$container->parameters`, tag passing, not calling `$container->findByTag()`, and significantly reduce metadata for autowiring by listing the classes you use as parameters for method `$container->getByType()`. Example:

```neon
di:
	export:
		# to export parameters?
		parameters: false   # (bool) defaults to true

		# export tags and which ones?
		tags: false         # (string[]|bool) the default is all

		# export data for autowiring and which?
		types:              # (string[]|bool) the default is all
			- Nette\Database\Connection
			- Nette\Application\Application
```


Extensions
==========

Registration of other DI extensions. In this way we add, for exammple, DI extension `Dibi\Bridges\Nette\DibiExtension22` under the name `dibi`:

```neon
extensions:
	dibi: Dibi\Bridges\Nette\DibiExtension22
```

Then we configure it in it's section called also `dibi`:

```neon
dibi:
	host: localhost
```

You can also add a extension class with parameters:

```neon
extensions:
	application: Nette\Bridges\ApplicationDI\ApplicationExtension(%debugMode%, %appDir%, %tempDir%/cache)
```


Forms
=====

You can change the default form error messages in the configuration file.

```neon
forms:
	messages:
		EQUAL: 'Please enter %s.'
		NOT_EQUAL: 'This value should not be %s.'
		FILLED: 'This field is required.'
		BLANK: 'This field should be blank.'
		MIN_LENGTH: 'Please enter at least %d characters.'
		MAX_LENGTH: 'Please enter no more than %d characters.'
		LENGTH: 'Please enter a value between %d and %d characters long.'
		EMAIL: 'Please enter a valid email address.'
		URL: 'Please enter a valid URL.'
		INTEGER: 'Please enter a valid integer.'
		FLOAT: 'Please enter a valid number.'
		MIN: 'Please enter a value greater than or equal to %d.'
		MAX: 'Please enter a value less than or equal to %d.'
		RANGE: 'Please enter a value between %d and %d.'
		MAX_FILE_SIZE: 'The size of the uploaded file can be up to %d bytes.'
		MAX_POST_SIZE: 'The uploaded data exceeds the limit of %d bytes.'
		MIME_TYPE: 'The uploaded file is not in the expected format.'
		IMAGE: 'The uploaded file must be image in format JPEG, GIF, PNG or WebP.'
		Nette\Forms\Controls\SelectBox::VALID: 'Please select a valid option.'
		Nette\Forms\Controls\UploadControl::VALID: 'An error occurred during file upload.'
		Nette\Forms\Controls\CsrfProtection::PROTECTION: 'Your session has expired. Please return to the home page and try again.'
```


HTTP headers
============

```neon
http:
	# headers that are sent with each request
	headers:
		X-Powered-By: MyCMS
		X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
		X-XSS-Protection: '1; mode=block'

	# affects header X-Frame-Options
	frames: ...      # (string|bool) defaults to 'SAMEORIGIN'
```

For security reasons, the framework sends a header `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, which says that a page can be displayed inside another page (in element `<iframe>`) only if it is on the same domain. This can be unwanted in certain situations (for example, if you are developing a Facebook application), so the behavior can be changed by setting `frames: http://allowed-host.com` or `frames: true`.

Headers `Content-Security-Policy` (hereinafter referred to as CSP) can be easily assembled, their description can be found in [documentation |https://content-security-policy.com]. CSP directives (such as `script-src`) can be written either as strings according to specification or as arrays of values ​​for better readability. Then there is no need to write quotation marks around keywords such as `'self'`. Nette will also automatically generate a value of `nonce`, so `'nonce-y4PopTLM=='` will be send in the header.

```neon
http:
	# Content Security Policy
	csp:
		# string according to CSP specification
		default-src: "'self' https://example.com"

		# array of values
		script-src:
			- nonce
			- strict-dynamic
			- self
			- https://example.com

		# bool in the case of switches
		upgrade-insecure-requests: true
		block-all-mixed-content: false
```

Use `<script n:nonce>...</script>` in the templates and the nonce value will be filled in automatically. Making secure websites in Nette is really easy.

Similarly, headers `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` (which can be used in parallel with CSP) and [Feature Policy |https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/06/feature-policy] can be added:

```neon
http:
	# Content Security Policy Report-Only
	cspReportOnly:
		default-src: self
		report-uri: 'https://my-report-uri-endpoint'

	# Feature Policy
	featurePolicy:
		unsized-media: none
		geolocation:
			- self
			- https://example.com
```


HTTP cookie
-----------

By default, method `Nette\Http\Response::setCookie()` sends a cookie with the following parameters:
- with scope for current domain (but not subdomains)
- and all directories (`Path = '/'`)
- with flag `HttpOnly` (cookie is inaccessible for JavaScript)
- without flag `SameSite`
- without flag `Secure`

This behavior can be changed by configuration:

```neon
http:
	# to send cookies only via HTTPS?
	cookieSecure: ...      # (bool|auto) defaults to false
```

HTTP proxy
----------

If the site is running behind an HTTP proxy, enter its IP address in order to correctly detect the IP address of the client (`Nette\Http\Request::getRemoteAddress()`).

```neon
http:
	# IP address, range, hostname or array of these values
	proxy: 127.0.0.1       # (string|string[]) defaults to none
```


Including files
===============

Additional configuration files can be inserted in the `includes` section:

```neon
includes:
	- parameters.php
	- services.neon
	- presenters.neon
```

The name `parameters.php` is not a typo, the configuration can also be written in a PHP file, which returns it as an array:

```php
<?php
return [
	'database' => [
		'main' => [
			'dsn' => 'sqlite::memory:',
		],
	],
];
```

If items with the same keys appear within configuration files, they will be [overwritten or merged |di-services#Multiple configuration files] in the case of arrays. Later included file has a higher priority than the previous one. The file in which the `includes` section is listed has a higher priority than the files included in it.


Latte
=====

This setting globally affects the behavior of Latte in components and presenters.

```neon
latte:
	# switches Latte to XHTML mode
	xhtml: ...           # (bool) defaults to false

	# generates templates with declare(strict_types=1)
	strictTypes: ...     # (bool) defaults to false

	# class of $this->template
	templateClass: App\MyTemplateClass # defaults to Nette\Bridges\ApplicationLatte\Template
```

It is also possible to register new tags either by entering the class name or by referring to the service. Method `install()` is called by default, but this can be changed by specifying the name of another method:

```neon
latte:
	# registration of user Latte tags
	macros:
		- App\MyLatteMacros::register         # static method, classname or callable
		- @App\MyLatteMacrosFactory           # service with install method
		- @App\MyLatteMacrosFactory::register # service with register method

services:
	- App\MyLatteMacrosFactory
```


Mail
====

By default, the mailer [api:Nette\Mail\SendmailMailer] is used to send e-mails, which is not further configured. However, we can switch it to [api:Nette\Mail\SmtpMailer]:

```neon
mail:
	# use SmtpMailer
	smtp: true       # (bool) defaults to false

	host: ...        # (string)
	port: ...        # (int)
	username: ...    # (string)
	password: ...    # (string)
	timeout: ...     # (int)
	secure: ...      # (ssl|tls|null) defaults to null
	clientHost: ...  # (string) defaults to $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST']
	persistent: ...  # (bool) defaults to false

	# context for connecting to the SMTP server, see stream_context_create()
	context:         # (array) defaults to stream_context_get_default()
```

To increase trustfulness, we can sign emails using [DKIM technology |https://blog.nette.org/en/sign-emails-with-dkim]:

```neon
mail:
	dkim:
		domain: myweb.com
	    selector: lovenette
	    privateKey: %appDir%/cert/dkim.priv
	    passPhrase: ...
	    testMode: ...
```


Parameters
==========

You can define parameters that can then be used as part of service definitions. This can help to separate out values that you will want to change more regularly.

```neon
parameters:
	dsn: 'mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test'
	user: root
	password: secret
```

You can refer to `foo` parameter via `%foo%` elsewhere in any config file. They can also be used inside strings like `'%wwwDir%/images'`.

Parameters do not need to be just strings, they can also be array values:

```neon
parameters:
	mailer:
		host: smtp.example.com
		secure: ssl
		user: franta@gmail.com
	languages: [cs, en, de]
```

You can refer to single key as `%mailer.user%`.

.[note]
To write a string containing `%`, you must escape the character by doubling to `%%`.

If you need to get the value of any parameter in your code, for example in your class, then pass it to this class. For example, in the constructor. There is no global configuration object which can classes query for parameter values. This would be against to the principle of dependency injection.


PHP
===

You can set PHP directives. An overview of all directives can be found at [php.net |https://php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php].

```neon
php:
	date.timezone: Europe/Prague
```


Routing
=======

Basic settings:

```neon
routing:
	# shows routing panel in Tracy Bar?
	debugger: ...   # (bool) defaults to true

	# to serialize router to DI container?
	cache: ...      # (bool) defaults to false
```

Router is usually defined in the RouterFactory class, a more limited alternative can be defined in the configuration file using pairs `mask: action`:

```neon
routing:
	routes:
		'detail/<id>': Admin:Home:default
		'<presenter>/<action>': Front:Home:default
```



Search
======

The automatic adding of services to the DI container makes work extremely pleasant. Nette automatically adds presenters to the container, but you can easily add any other classes.

Just specify in which directories (and subdirectories) the classes should be search for:

```neon
search:
	# you choose the section names yourself
	myForms:
		in: %appDir%/Forms

	model:
		in: %appDir%/Model
```

Usually, however, we don't want to add all the classes and interfaces, so we can filter them:

```neon
search:
	myForms:
		in: %appDir%/Forms

		# filtering by file name (string|string[])
		files:
			- *Factory.php

		# filtering by class name (string|string[])
		classes:
			- *Factory
```

Or we can select classes that inherit or implement at least one of the following classes:


```neon
search:
	myForms:
		extends:
			- App\*Form
		implements:
			- App\*FormInterface
```

You can also define negative rules, ie class name masks or ancestors and if they comply, the service will not be added to the DI container:

```neon
search:
	myForms:
		exclude:
			classes: ...
			extends: ...
			implements: ...
```

Tags can be set for added services:

```neon
search:
	myForms:
		tags: ...
```



Security: Access Control
========================

You can define a list of users in the configuration file to create a simple authenticator (`Nette\Security\SimpleAuthenticator`). Because passwords are readable in the configuration file, this solution is for testing purposes only.

```neon
security:
	# shows user panel in Tracy Bar?
	debugger: ...  # (bool) defaults to true

	users:
		# name and password
		johndoe: secret123

		# name, password, role and other data available in the identity
		janedoe:
			password: secret123
			roles: [admin]
			data: ...
```

/--comment
You can also define `roles`,` resources` and also the roles of individual users and create an authorizer (`Nette\Security\Permission`):

```neon
security:
	roles:
		guest:
		member:
		admin: [member]  # admin extends member

	resources:
		file:

	users:
		frantisek:
			password: tajneheslo
			roles: [member]
			data: ...
```
\--


Session
=======

Basic settings:

```neon
session:
	# shows session panel in Tracy Bar?
	debugger: ...        # (bool) defaults to false

	# inactivity time after which the session expires
	expiration: 14 days  # (string) defaults to '3 hours'

	# start session automatically?
	# 'smart' starts a session if it is already created
	autoStart: ...       # (bool|smart) defaults to 'smart'
```

The cookie settings are taken from the [#HTTP cookie] settings, you can also adjust options `cookieDomain` and `cookieSamesite`.

The `cookieDomain` option specifies which hosts are allowed to receive the cookie. If unspecified, it defaults to the same host that set the cookie, *excluding* subdomains. If `cookieDomain` is specified, then subdomains are always included.
Therefore, specifying `cookieDomain` is less restrictive than omitting it. For example, if `cookieDomain: nette.org` is set, then cookies are available on subdomains like `doc.nette.org`. The same thing can be achieved by `cookieDomain: domain`.

The `cookieSamesite` option lets servers require that a cookie shouldn't be sent with cross-origin requests, which provides some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks (CSRF). Possible values are Strict, Lax, and None.

```neon
session:
	# which hosts are allowed to receive the cookie
	cookieDomain: 'example.com'  # (string) defaults to unset

	# require that a cookie shouldn't be sent with cross-origin requests?
	cookieSamesite: Lax          # (Strict|Lax|None) defaults to unset
```

You can also set all PHP [session directives |https://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php] (in camelCase format) and also [readAndClose |https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-start.php#refsect1-function.session-start-parameters]:

```neon
session:
	# 'session.name' written as 'name'
	name: MYID

	# 'session.save_path' written as 'savePath'
	savePath: "%tempDir%/sessions"
```


Tracy debugger
==============

You can set the [Tracy |tracy:] parameters in the configuration file and also add new panels to the Tracy Bar. These settings are applied only after the DI container has been created, so errors that occurred earlier cannot reflect them.

Error logging configuration:

```neon
tracy:
	# if error has occurred the notification is sent to this email
	email: dev@example.com           # (string|string[]) defaults to unset

	# email sender
	fromEmail: robot@example.com     # (string) defaults to unset

	# to use a mailer defined in the configuration? (since Tracy 2.5)
	netteMailer: ...                 # (bool) defaults to true

	# for which error levels is BlueScreen also logged?
	logSeverity: [E_WARNING, E_NOTICE]  # defaults to []
```

Configuration for function `dump()`:

```neon
tracy:
	# maximum string length
	maxLength: 150             # (int) default according to Tracy

	# how deep will list
	maxDepth: 10               # (int) default according to Tracy

	# maximum number of elements in array or object (since Tracy 2.9)
	maxItems: 100              # (int) default according to Tracy

	# hide values of these keys (since Tracy 2.9)
	keysToHide: [password, pass]  # (string[]) defaults to []

	# visual theme (od Tracy 2.9)
	theme: dark                # (light|dark) defaults to 'light'

	# displays the location where dump() was called?
	showLocation: ...          # (bool) default according to Tracy
```

To install the Tracy extension:

```neon
tracy:
	# appends bars to Tracy Bar
	bar:
		- Nette\Bridges\DITracy\ContainerPanel
		- IncludePanel
		- XDebugHelper('myIdeKey')
		- MyPanel(@MyService)

	# append panels to BlueScreen
	blueScreen:
		- DoctrinePanel::renderException
```

Other options:

```neon
tracy:
	# in Development mode, you will see notice or error warnings as BlueScreen
	strictMode: ...           # (bool) defaults to true

	# displays silent (@) error messages
	scream: ...               # (bool) defaults to false

	# link format to open in the editor
	editor: ....              # (string) defaults to 'editor://open/?file=%file&line=%line'

	# path to template with custom page for error 500
	errorTemplate: ...        # (string) defaults to unset

	# shows Tracy Bar?
	showBar: ...              # (bool) defaults to true

	editorMapping:
		# original: new
		/var/www/html: /data/web
		/home/web: /srv/html
```


Services and Modifications
==========================

The configuration file is a place where we add the definitions of our own services in section `services`. A detailed description can be found in chapter [Services |di-services].

For example, this is the definition of service named `database` which is `PDO` instance:

```neon
services:
	database: PDO('mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test', root, password)
```

There are also a number of system and [#extensions] services in the DI container. The definitions of these services can be changed in the configuration. For example, we can change the class of service `application.application`, which is by default `Nette\Application\Application`:

```neon
services:
	application.application:
		factory: MyApplication
		alteration: true
```

The `alteration` flag is informative and says we only modify an existing service.

We can also add setup:

```neon
services:
	application.application:
		factory: MyApplication
		alteration: true
		setup:
			- $onStartup = [@resource::init]
```

You can also remove a system service from the container:

```neon
services:
	cache.journal: false
```
