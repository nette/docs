Forms

<div class=perex>

Nette Forms has revolutionized the creation of web forms. All you had to do was write a few clear lines of code and you had a form, including rendering, JavaScript, and server validation, plus industry-leading security. Let's see how

- create friendly forms
- validate sent data on the server side and client side
- and render forms exactly as needed

</div>


With Nette Forms, you can diminish routine tasks like double validation on both server and client-side. You can also avoid common mistakes and security issues.

Nette Framework puts a great effort to be safe and since forms are the most common user input, Nette forms are as good as impenetrable. All is maintained dynamically and transparently, nothing has to be set manually. Well-known vulnerabilities such as [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) |vulnerability-protection#cross-site-scripting-xss] and [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)|vulnerability-protection#cross-site-request-forgery-csrf] are filtered, as well as special control characters. All inputs are checked for UTF-8 validity. Every multiple-choice, select box and similar are checked for forged values upon validating. Sounds good? Let's try it out.

You can use the forms either as a part of the Nette Application (ie in presenters) or standalone. Because the use is slightly different in both cases, we have prepared separated instructions for you:

.[wiki-forms-buttons]
- [Forms in presenters|form-presenter]
- [Forms standalone|form-standalone]
