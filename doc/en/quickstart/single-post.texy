Single Post Page
****************

.[perex]
Let’s add another page to our blog, which will display content of one particular blog post.

We need to create another render method, that will fetch one concrete blog post, and pass it to template. This method can be placed at the end of `HomepagePresenter`.

/--php
	public function renderDetail($postId)
	{
		$this->template->post = $this->database->table('posts')->get($postId);
	}
\--

The `renderDetail` method requires one argument - the *id* of the post to be displayed. It then loads the post from database and passes the result to template.

In the `app/templates/Homepage/default.latte` template, we’ve already created a link to the `detail` action, which doesn’t exist yet. You can try to open a post in your browser using the link of the page on the homepage. [Tracy | /debugging] will show an error, because the `app/templates/Homepage/detail.latte` template has not yet been created. So let’s add that one as well:

/--html
{block #content}

<p><a n:href="default">← back to posts list</a></p>

<div class="date">{$post->created_at|date:'F j, Y'}</div>

<h1 n:block="title">{$post->title}</h1>

<div class="post">{!$post->content}</div>
\--

Let’s have a look at individual parts.

First line starts the definition of a *named block* called "content", which will be displayed in a *layout template*, that we were talking about earlier.

Second line provides a back link to the list of blog posts, so that the user can navigate smoothly back and forth on our blog. It is specified in `n:href`, therefore Nette will take care of generating the URL. And it points to `default` action of the same presenter (you could have written `n:href="Homepage:default"`).

The third line formats the publication timestamp, as we already know.

The fourth line displays the *title* of the blog post into a header (h1). There is one part which you may not be familiar with, and that is `n:block=title`. Can you guess what it does? If you’ve read carefully the previous parts, there was a mention about `n: attributes`. This is a another one. It is an equivalent to:

/--html
{block #title}<h1>{$post->title}</h1>{/block}
\--

In human words, it *re-defines* a block called `title`. The block has been defined in *layout template* (`/app/templates/@layout.latte:8`) and like with OOP overriding, it gets overridden here. Therefore, the page’s `<title>` will contain the title of displayed post. We’ve overridden the title of the page and all we needed was `n:block="title"`. Great, huh?

Fifth and the last line of detail template displays full content of your post. But what does the exclamation mark means there? In two words, it *disables escaping*. Proper escaping of user data is very important for security reasons, so that you cannot accidentally put a malicious HTML/JavaScript code into your page (more importantly, an attacker cannot do it). Latte has context sensitive escaping enabled by default, which will convert any entered HTML so that it is safe to output. But we’re geeks and we want to write our posts in HTML (at least for now), and therefore the content shall not be escaped. Here comes the exclamation mark.

If you don’t need HTML code in your posts, don’t put the exclamation mark there.



Refactoring & Cleaup
====================

We have it working, so let’s clean up the code now.

What happens if someone alters the URL and inserts `postId` which does not exist? We shall provide the user with a nice error "page not found". Let’s update the render method:
/--php
	public function renderDetail($postId)
	{
		if (!$post = $this->database->table('posts')->get($postId)) {
			$this->error("Post not found");
		}

		$this->template->post = $post;
	}
\--

If the post cannot be found, calling `$this->error(...)` will show a 404 page with a nice and understandable message. Note, that in your development environment (on your laptop), you won’t see the error page, but instead Tracy will show the exception will full details. This is pretty convenient for development.

Secondly, it is not nice to have a *detail* view in *HomepagePresenter*. Because it’s detail of blog post, not Homepage. Let’s create a designated presenter and move the code there.

Create a new class `PostPresenter` and place it to `app/presenters/PostPresenter.php`. It will need database connection, so put there the *database injection* code. Also, move the `renderDetail` method and rename it to `renderDefault`. Now it makes sense: `Homepage:default` (Homepage presenter, default action) shows the recent posts, while `Post:default` (Post presenter, default action) shows one concrete post.

The `PostPresenter` should look like this:

/--php
class PostPresenter extends BasePresenter
{
	/** @var \Nette\Database\Connection */
	private $database;

	public function __construct(\Nette\Database\Connection $database)
	{
		$this->database = $database;
	}

	public function renderDefault($postId)
	{
		if (!$post = $this->database->table('posts')->get($postId)) {
			$this->error("Post not found");
		}

		$this->template->post = $post;
	}
}
\--

You’ll also need to update the links - the link on homepage shall now point to `n:href="Post:, $post->id"`, and the back link to `n:href="Homepage:"`.

That’s it. Double check in the browser that everything works so we can move to implementing some more cool features.

Summary
=======

We have a database with blog posts and a web app with two views - first to show summary of all recent posts and second one to display one concrete post.
