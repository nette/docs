RobotLoader: Class Autoloading
******************************

<div class=perex>

RobotLoader is a tool that gives you comfort of automated class loading for your entire application including third-party libraries.

- get rid of all `require`
- only necessary scripts are loaded
- requires no strict file naming conventions
- allows more classes in single file

</div>

[RobotLoader |api:Nette\Loaders\RobotLoader] is extremely comfortable and addictive!

So we can forget about those famous code blocks:

```php
require_once 'Utils/Page.php';
require_once 'Utils/Style.php';
require_once 'Utils/Paginator.php';
...
```


Installation
------------

```shell
composer require nette/robot-loader
```


Usage
-----

Like the Google robot crawls and indexes websites, [RobotLoader |api:Nette\Loaders\RobotLoader] crawls all PHP scripts and records what classes and interfaces were found in them. These records are then saved in cache and used during all subsequent requests. You just need to specify what directories to index and where to save the cache:

```php
$loader = new Nette\Loaders\RobotLoader;

// directories to be indexed by RobotLoader (including subdirectories)
$loader->addDirectory(__DIR__ . '/app');
$loader->addDirectory(__DIR__ . '/libs');

// use 'temp' directory for cache
$loader->setCacheStorage(new Nette\Caching\Storages\FileStorage(__DIR__ . '/temp'));
$loader->register(); // Run the RobotLoader
```

And that's all. From now on, you don't need to use `require`. Great, isn't it?

When RobotLoader encounters duplicate class name during indexing, it throws an exception and informs you about it.

The variable `$loader->autoBuild` determines whether RobotLoader should reindex the scripts if asked for nonexistent class.
This feature is disabled by default on production server.

.[note]
Therefore, you need to delete the cache when you upload a new version of the application to the hosting.

If you want RobotLoader to skip some directory, create a file there called `netterobots.txt`:

```
Disallow: /Zend
```

From this point on, the Zend directory will not be indexed.


Nette Application
-----------------

Inside Nette application, where `$configurator` is used in `bootstrap.php`, you can setup RobotLoader this way:

```php
$configurator = new Nette\Configurator;
...
$configurator->setTempDirectory(__DIR__ . '/../temp');
$configurator->createRobotLoader()
	->addDirectory(__DIR__)
	->addDirectory(__DIR__ . '/../libs')
	->register();
```



{{composer: nette/robot-loader}}
