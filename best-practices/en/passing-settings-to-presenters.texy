Passing Settings to Presenters
******************************

.[perex]
Do you need to pass non-object arguments to presenters (like a flag indicating debug mode, directory paths, etc.) which cannot be automatically passed via autowiring? The solution is to encapsulate them within a dedicated `Settings` object.

The `Settings` service provides a very simple yet effective way to supply information about the running application to presenters. Its specific structure depends entirely on your particular needs. Example:

```php
namespace App;

class Settings
{
	public function __construct(
		// since PHP 8.1, readonly can be used
		public bool $debugMode,
		public string $appDir,
		// and so on
	) {}
}
```

Example of registering it in the configuration:

```neon
services:
	- App\Settings(
		%debugMode%,
		%appDir%,
	)
```

When a presenter requires the information provided by this service, it simply requests it in its constructor:

```php
class MyPresenter extends Nette\Application\UI\Presenter
{
	public function __construct(
		private App\Settings $settings,
	) {}

	public function renderDefault()
	{
		if ($this->settings->debugMode) {
			// ...
		}
	}
}
```
