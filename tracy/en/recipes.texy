Content Security Policy
=======================

If your site uses Content Security Policy, you'll need to add `'nonce-<value>'` to `script-src` and eventually the same nonce to `style-src` for Tracy to work properly. Some 3rd plugins may require additional directives. Avoid adding `'unsafe-inline'` & `'unsafe-eval'` in production mode, if you can.

Configuration example for [Nette Framework |doc:configuring]:

```neon
http:
	csp:
		script-src: nonce
		style-src: nonce
```


Faster loading
==============

The basic integration is straightforward, however if you have slow blocking scripts in web page, they can slow the Tracy loading.
The solution is to place `<?php Tracy\Debugger::renderLoader() ?>` into your template before
any scripts:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>...<title>
	<?php Tracy\Debugger::renderLoader() ?>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/style.css">
	<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"></script>
</head>
```


AJAX and redirected requests
============================

Tracy is able to show Debug bar and Bluescreens for AJAX and redirected requests. You just have to start session before Tracy:

```php
session_start();
Debugger::enable();
```

In case you use non-standard session handler, you can start Tracy immediately (in order to handle any errors), then initialize your session handler
and then inform Tracy that session is ready to use via `dispatch()`:

```php
Debugger::enable();

// initialize session handler
session_start();

Debugger::dispatch();
```


Custom Logger
=============

We can create a custom logger to log errors, uncatched exceptions, and also be called by `Tracy\Debugger::log()`. Logger implements the interface [api:Tracy\ILogger].

```php
use Tracy\ILogger;

class SlackLogger implements ILogger
{
	public function log($value, $priority = ILogger::INFO)
	{
		// sends a request to Slack
	}
}
```

And then we activate it:

```php
Tracy\Debugger::setLogger(new SlackLogger);
```

If we use the full Nette Framework, we can set it in the NEON configuration file:

```neon
services:
	tracy.logger: SlackLogger
```


nginx
=====

If Tracy does not work on nginx, it is probably misconfigured. If there is something like

```nginx
try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php;
```

change it to

```nginx
try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
```
