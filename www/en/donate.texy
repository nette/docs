*************************

It is in the highest interest of every company or individual, that builds their website on Nette, that the framework is actively developed. From supporting new versions of PHP and fixing bugs to coming up with new innovative solutions, which will save you time and money. Professional documentation and useful content like videos, tutorials and articles are crucial for every user to make their work easier and more comfortable.

We take pride in providing excellent world-class quality, that many parts of Nette represent, and we would like them to do so in future as well.

However, it cannot be guaranteed without proper funding. If you want to ensure a healthy and sustainable progress of the framework, thereÂ´s only a small thing you need to do - support Nette development by a monthly payment. Even a humble amount of money can make a difference.
