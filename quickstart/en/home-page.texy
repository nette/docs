Blog Home Page
**************

.[perex]
Let’s create the home page displaying your recent posts.


Before we start, you should know at least some basics about the Model-View-Presenter design pattern (similar to MVC((Model-View-Controller))):

- **Model** - the layer working with data. It is completely separated from the rest of the application. It only communicates with the presenter.

- **View** - the front-end layer. It renders requested data using templates and displays it to the user.

- **Presenter** (or Controller) - the connection layer. The presenter connects the Model and the View. It handles requests, asks the Model for data, and then passes them to the View.


In the case of a simple application like our blog, the entire model layer will consist only of database queries - we don't need any extra PHP code for that yet. So, for starters, we will only create presenters and templates. In Nette, each presenter has its own templates, so we will create them simultaneously.


Creating the Database with Adminer
==================================

To store the data, we will use a MySQL database because it is the most common choice among web developers. However, if you don't want to use it, feel free to choose a database of your choice.

Let’s prepare the database structure which will store our blog posts. We can start very simply - just with a single table for posts.

To create the database, we can download [Adminer |https://www.adminer.org], or use another database management tool you prefer.


Let’s open Adminer and create a new database called `quickstart`.

Create a new table named `posts` and add these columns:
- `id` int, check autoincrement (AI)
- `title` varchar, length 255
- `content` text
- `created_at` timestamp

It should look like this:

[* adminer-posts.webp *]

```sql
CREATE TABLE `posts` (
	`id` int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
	`title` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
	`content` text NOT NULL,
	`created_at` timestamp NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
) ENGINE=InnoDB CHARSET=utf8;
```

.[caution]
It’s very important to use the **InnoDB** storage engine. You will see the reason later. For now, just choose it and click Save.

Try adding some sample blog posts manually before we implement adding new posts directly from our application.

```sql
INSERT INTO `posts` (`id`, `title`, `content`, `created_at`) VALUES
(1,	'Article One',	'Lorem ipusm dolor one',	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
(2,	'Article Two',	'Lorem ipsum dolor two',	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
(3,	'Article Three',	'Lorem ipsum dolor three',	CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
```


Connecting to the Database
==========================

Now that the database is created and we have some posts in it, it’s the right time to display them on our brand new page.

First, we need to tell our application which database to use. The database connection configuration is set in the `config/common.neon` file using DSN((Data Source Name)) and credentials. It should look something like this:

```neon .{file:config/common.neon}
database:
	dsn: 'mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=quickstart'
	user: *enter your username here*
	password: *enter your database password here*
```

.[note]
Be careful with indentation while editing this file. The [NEON format |neon:format] accepts both spaces and tabs, but not both together. The default configuration file in the Web Project uses tabs.


Injecting the Database Connection
=================================

The presenter `HomePresenter`, which will list the posts, needs a database connection. To receive it, we'll use the constructor like this:

```php .{file:app/Presentation/Home/HomePresenter.php}
<?php
namespace App\Presentation\Home;

use Nette;

final class HomePresenter extends Nette\Application\UI\Presenter
{
	public function __construct(
		private Nette\Database\Explorer $database,
	) {
	}

	// ...
}
```


Loading Posts from the Database
===============================

Now let’s fetch the posts from the database and pass them to the template, which will then render the HTML code. This is what the so-called *render* method is for:

```php .{file:app/Presentation/Home/HomePresenter.php}
public function renderDefault(): void
{
	$this->template->posts = $this->database
		->table('posts')
		->order('created_at DESC')
		->limit(5);
}
```

The presenter now has one render method `renderDefault()`, which passes data from the database to the template (View). Templates are located in `app/Presentation/{PresenterName}/{viewName}.latte`, so in this case, the template is located in `app/Presentation/Home/default.latte`. In the template, a variable named `$posts` is now available, containing the posts fetched from the database.


Template
========

For the entire website, we have a main template (called *layout*, containing the header, styles, footer, ...) and specific templates for each view (e.g., for displaying blog posts), which can override parts of the main template.

By default, the layout template is located in `app/Presentation/@layout.latte` and contains:

```latte .{file:app/Presentation/@layout.latte}
...
{include content}
...
```

The `{include content}` tag inserts a block named `content` into the main template. We will define this block in the templates for individual views. In our case, we will modify the `Home/default.latte` file as follows:

```latte .{file:app/Presentation/Home/default.latte}
{block content}
	Hello World
{/block}
```

This defines the *content* [block |latte:tags#block], which will be inserted into the main layout. If you refresh the browser again, you will see a page with the text "Hello World" (in the source code, also with the HTML header and footer defined in `@layout.latte`).

Let’s display the blog posts - we will modify the template as follows:

```latte .{file:app/Presentation/Home/default.latte}
{block content}
	<h1>My Blog</h1>

	{foreach $posts as $post}
	<div class="post">
		<div class="date">{$post->created_at|date:'F j, Y'}</div>

		<h2>{$post->title}</h2>

		<div>{$post->content|truncate:256}</div>
	</div>
	{/foreach}
{/block}
```

If you refresh your browser, you’ll see the list of your blog posts. The list isn't very fancy or colorful yet, so feel free to add some [nice CSS styles |https://github.com/nette-examples/quickstart/blob/v4.0/www/css/style.css] to the `www/css/style.css` file and link it in the layout:

```latte .{file:app/Presentation/@layout.latte}
	...
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="{$basePath}/css/style.css">
</head>
...
```

The `{foreach}` tag iterates over all posts passed to the template in the `$posts` variable and displays a piece of HTML code for each post. It behaves just like PHP code.

The `|date:` notation is called a filter. Filters are used to format the output. This particular filter converts a date (e.g., `2013-04-12`) to its more readable form (`April 12, 2013`). The `|truncate` filter truncates the string to the specified maximum length and adds an ellipsis (...) to the end if the string is truncated. Since this is a preview, there is no point in displaying the full content of the post. Other default filters [can be found in the documentation |latte:filters], or you can create your own if needed.

One more thing. We can make the previous code shorter and simpler. We achieve this by replacing *Latte tags* with *n:attributes*:

```latte .{file:app/Presentation/Home/default.latte}
{block content}
	<h1>My Blog</h1>

	<div n:foreach="$posts as $post" class="post">
		<div class="date">{$post->created_at|date:'F j, Y'}</div>

		<h2>{$post->title}</h2>

		<div>{$post->content|truncate:256}</div>
	</div>
{/block}
```

The `n:foreach` attribute wraps the *div* block with a *foreach* loop (it works exactly the same as the previous code).


Summary
=======

We now have a very simple MySQL database with a few posts. The application connects to this database and displays a simple list of these posts in a template.
