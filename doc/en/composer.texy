Composer
********

<div class=perex>

Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries your project depends on and it will install and update them for you. We will learn

- how to install Composer
- use it in new or existing project

</div>


Installation
============

Composer is an executable `.phar` file that you download and install as follows.


Windows
-------

Use the official installer [Composer-Setup.exe|https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe].


Linux, macOS
------------

All you need is 4 commands, which you can copy from [this page |https: //getcomposer.org/download/].

Further more, by copying into folder that is in system's `PATH`, Composer becomes globally accessible:

```shell
$ mv ./composer.phar ~/bin/composer # or /usr/local/bin/composer
```


Use in an existing project
==========================

To start using Composer in your project, all you need is a `composer.json` file. This file describes the dependencies of your project and may contain other metadata as well. The simplest `composer.json` can look like this:

```js
{
	"require": {
		"nette/database": "^3.0"
	}
}
```

We're saying here, that our application (or library) depends on package `nette/database` (the package name consists of a vendor name and the project's name) and it wants the version that matches the `^3.0` version constraint.

So, when we have the `composer.json` file in the project root and we run:

```shell
composer update
```

Composer will download the Nette Database into directory `vendor`. It also creates a `composer.lock` file, which contains information about exactly which library versions it installed.

Composer generates a `vendor/autoload.php` file. You can simply include this file and start using the classes that those libraries provide without any extra work:

```php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$db = new Nette\Database\Connection('sqlite::memory:');
```


Creating New Project
====================

New Nette project can be created by executing a simple command:

```shell
composer create-project nette/web-project name-of-the-project
```

Instead the `name-of-the-project` you should provide the name of the directory for your project and execute the command. Composer will fetch the `nette/web-project` repository from GitHub, which already contains the `composer.json` file, and right after that install the Nette Framework itself. The only thing which remains is to [check write permissions |troubleshooting#setting-directory-permissions] on directories `temp/` and `log/` and you're ready to go.


PHP Version
===========

Composer always installs those versions of packages that are compatible with the version of PHP you are currently using. Which, of course, may not be the same version as PHP on your web host. Therefore, it is useful to add information about the PHP version on the host to the `composer.json` file, and then only versions of packages compatible with host will be installed:

```js
{
	"require": {
		...
	},
	"config": {
		"platform": {
			"php": "7.2"   # PHP verion on host
		}
	}
}
```


Packagist.org - Global Repository
=================================

[Packagist |http://packagist.org] is the main package repository, in which Composer tries to search packages, if not told otherwise. You can also publish your own packages here.



What If We Don't Want the Central Repository
--------------------------------------------

If we have internal applications or libraries in our company, which cannot be hosted publicly on Packagist, we can create our own repositories for those project.

More on repositories in [the official documentation |http://getcomposer.org/doc/05-repositories.md#repositories].



Configuration
=============

Composer is closely integrated with version control tool [Git |http://git-scm.com]. If you do not use Git, it is necessary to tell it to Composer:

```shell
composer -g config preferred-install dist
```
