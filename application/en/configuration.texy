Configuring Application
***********************

.[perex]
Overview of configuration options for the Nette Application.


Application
===========

```neon
application:
	# shows "Nette Application" panel in Tracy BlueScreen?
	debugger: ...           # (bool) defaults to true

	# will error-presenter be called on error?
	catchExceptions: ...    # (bool) defaults to true in production mode

	# name of error-presenter
	errorPresenter: Error   # (string) defaults to 'Nette:Error'

	# defines the rules for resolving the presenter name to a class
	mapping: ...

	# do bad links generate warnings?
	# has effect only in developer mode
	silentLinks: ...        # (bool) defaults to false
```

Because error-presenters are not called by default in development mode and the errors are displayed by Tracy, changing the value `catchExceptions` to `true` helps to verify that error-presenters works correct during development.

Option `silentLinks` determines how Nette behaves in developer mode when link generation fails (for example, because there is no presenter, etc). The default value `false` means that Nette triggers `E_USER_WARNING`. Setting to `true` suppresses this error message. In a production environment, `E_USER_WARNING` is always invoked. We can also influence this behavior by setting the presenter variable [$invalidLinkMode |creating-links#Invalid Links].

The [mapping defines the rules |modules#mapping] by which the class name is derived from the presenter name.


Automatic Registration of Presenters
------------------------------------

Nette automatically adds presenters as services to the DI container, which significantly speeds up their creation. How Nette finds out presenters can be configured:

```neon
application:
	# to look for presenters in Composer class map?
	scanComposer: ...      # (bool) defaults to true

	# a mask that must match the class and file name
	scanFilter: ...        # (string) defaults to '*Presenter'

	# in which directories to look for presenters?
	scanDirs:              # (string[]|false) defaults to '%appDir%'
		- %vendorDir%/mymodule
```

The directories listed in `scanDirs` do not override the default value `%appDir%`, but complement it, so `scanDirs` will contain both paths `%appDir%` and `%vendorDir%/mymodule`. If we want to overwrite the default directory, we use [exclamation mark |dependency-injection:configuration#Merging]:

```neon
application:
	scanDirs!:
		- %vendorDir%/mymodule
```

Directory scanning can be turned off by setting false. We do not recommend completely suppressing the automatic addition of presenters, otherwise application performance will be reduced.


Latte
=====

This setting globally affects the behavior of Latte in components and presenters.

```neon
latte:
	# shows Latte panel in the Tracy Bar for the main template (true) or for all components (all)?
	debugger: ...        # (true|false|'all') defaults to true

	# generates templates with declare(strict_types=1)
	strictTypes: ...     # (bool) defaults to false

	# class of $this->template
	templateClass: App\MyTemplateClass # defaults to Nette\Bridges\ApplicationLatte\DefaultTemplate
```

If you are using Latte version 3, you can add new [extension |latte:creating-extension] using:

```neon
latte:
	extensions:
		- Latte\Essential\TranslatorExtension
```


Routing
=======

Basic settings:

```neon
routing:
	# shows routing panel in Tracy Bar?
	debugger: ...   # (bool) defaults to true

	# to serialize router to DI container?
	cache: ...      # (bool) defaults to false
```

Router is usually defined in the [RouterFactory |routing#Route Collection] class. Alternatively, routs can also be defined in the configuration using `mask: action` pairs, but this method does not offer such a wide variation in settings:

```neon
routing:
	routes:
		'detail/<id>': Admin:Home:default
		'<presenter>/<action>': Front:Home:default
```


Constants
=========

Creating PHP constants.

```neon
constants:
	Foobar: 'baz'
```

The `Foobar` constant will created after startup.

.[note]
Constants should not serve as globally available variables. To pass values to objects, use [dependency injection |dependency-injection:passing-dependencies].


PHP
===

You can set PHP directives. An overview of all directives can be found at [php.net |https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php].

```neon
php:
	date.timezone: Europe/Prague
```
