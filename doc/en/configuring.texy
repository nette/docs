Framework Configuration
***********************

.[perex]
An overview of all configuration options in Nette Framework.

Nette application is easily configured using [configuration files |bootstrap#Configuration files]. They are usually written in NEON format. Have fun [trying out |https://ne-on.org] the syntax.


Access Control
==============

By filling in `users` option you create `SimpleAuthenticator`, by defining `roles` or `resources` you create `Nette\Security\Permission` authorizator. More in [User Authorization and Privileges |access-control].

```neon
	security:
		debugger: true  # debugger bar panel

		users:
			johndoe: secretpassword

		roles:
			guest:
			member:
			admin: [member]  # admin extends member

		resources:
			file:
```


Application
===========

Errors
------

The `errorPresenter` specifies the presenter which is invoked when an error occurs. We can find [an example |https://github.com/nette/sandbox/blob/v3.0/app/Presenters/ErrorPresenter.php] in the sandbox.

Parameter `catchExceptions` decides if the error presenter will be invoked. By changing this value to `true` in the debug mode we can test functionality of the error presenter.

```neon
	application:
		debugger: true # shows panel in Tracy bar
		errorPresenter:  ...  # default: Nette:Error
		catchExceptions: ...  # default: enabled in production mode
		silentLinks: ...      # default: false
```

Option `silentLinks` specifies Nette behaviour in the debug mode when a link generation fails. With `false` value Nette will trigger `E_USER_WARNING`. Changing this configuration option to `true` will suppress this error. In production environment, E_USER_WARNING will be always triggered. We can also adjust this behaviour using class property [Presenter::$invalidLinkMode|presenters#Invalid links].

Mapping
-------

Default value: `*: *Module\*Presenter` (in the Sandbox change to `*: App\*Module\Presenters\*Presenter`)

This parameter contains an array with rules for converting presenter name to the class name. In the key we define a module name or `*` as a fallback for other modules. The value contains the rule mask:

```neon
application:
	mapping:
		Admin: App\Admin\*Module\*Presenter
		*: App\*Module\Presenters\*Presenter
```


The presenter `Front:Blog:Article` is contained inside the Front module. Since this module has no explicit mapping, the mapping with asterisk will be used and the class will be called `App\FrontModule\BlogModule\Presenters\ArticlePresenter`. The presenter `Admin:User:Edit` is part of the `Admin` module which has separate mapping so the name of the presenter class will be `App\Admin\UserModule\EditPresenter` (note that since the `Admin` is already in the mapping definition, it will be stripped from the resulting class name).

Automatic registration of presenters
------------------------------------

Nette automatically registers presenters as services. This step improves presenter creation speed. There are few configuration options that adjust where and how Nette looks for them.

The `scanComposer` specifies if Nette should look for presenters in the Composer classmap. The `scanFilter` specifies the string which must be included in the file and class name.

Value `scanDir` contains an array with directories where Nette looks for the presenters. If we specify another value in the configuration, it will be merged with the default one `%appDir%`:

```neon
application:
	scanComposer: false  # default: true
	scanFilter: Page  # default: Presenter
	scanDirs:
		- foo
```

In this case `scanDirs` will contain values `%appDir%` and `foo`. If we want to disable or overwrite this configuration option, we need to use `!` modifier:

```neon
application:
	scanDirs!:
		- foo
```

Now `scanDirs` will contain only `foo`.


Database
========

Mandatory item is only `dsn`:

```neon
	database:
			dsn: "sqlite:%appDir%/Model/demo.db"
```

The Framework creates not only the `Nette\Database\Connection` object, but also sets the auxiliary objects as a reflection & cache and adds a panel to the Tracy bar in the developer mode.

Other settings are as follows:

```neon
	database:
		dsn: 'mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test'
		user: root
		password: password
		options:
			PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_COMPRESS: true
			lazy: true  # establish a connection when it is needed for the first time
			driverClass:  .... # class database driver
		debugger: true         # show panel in Tracy bar
		explain:  true         # show query explains in Tracy bar
		autowired: true # enabled for first defined connection
		conventions: discovered # or 'static' or class name, the default is 'discovered'
```

In the `options` option, you can specify additional values ​​found in the PDO drivers documentation.

In the configuration file, we can define more than one database connection:

```neon
	database:
		main:
			dsn: 'mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test'
			user: root
			password: password

		anotherDb:
			dsn: 'sqlite::memory:'
```

Each connection defined in this way creates two services - the `Nette\Database\Connection` object named as `database.[NAME].connection` (in our case, `database.main.connection` and `database.anotherDb.connection`) and the `Nette\Database\Context` object named as `database.[NAME].context` that is used when working with the [Database Explorer] layer.

First connection services are passed through autowiring, however we can turn it off by `autowired: false`, and turn on for another connection via `autowired: true`.

Other non-autowired connections can be passed explicitly in the configuration:

```neon
services:
	- UserManager(@database.anotherDb.connection) # or @database.anotherDb.context
```


DI Container
============

```neon
	di:
		debugger: false  # disables DI panel
```


Forms
=====

You can change default validation error messages.

```neon
	forms:
		messages:
			PROTECTION: 'Your session has expired. Please return to the home page and try again.'
 			EQUAL: 'Please enter %s.'
 			NOT_EQUAL: 'This value should not be %s.'
 			FILLED: 'This field is required.'
 			BLANK: 'This field should be blank.'
 			MIN_LENGTH: 'Please enter at least %d characters.'
 			MAX_LENGTH: 'Please enter no more than %d characters.'
 			LENGTH: 'Please enter a value between %d and %d characters long.'
 			EMAIL: 'Please enter a valid email address.'
 			URL: 'Please enter a valid URL.'
 			INTEGER: 'Please enter a valid integer.'
 			FLOAT: 'Please enter a valid number.'
 			MIN: 'Please enter a value greater than or equal to %d.'
 			MAX: 'Please enter a value less than or equal to %d.'
 			RANGE: 'Please enter a value between %d and %d.'
 			MAX_FILE_SIZE: 'The size of the uploaded file can be up to %d bytes.'
 			MAX_POST_SIZE: 'The uploaded data exceeds the limit of %d bytes.'
 			MIME_TYPE: 'The uploaded file is not in the expected format.'
 			IMAGE: 'The uploaded file must be image in format JPEG, GIF or PNG.'
```


HTTP Headers
============

```neon
http:
	frames: ...               	  # header X-Frame-Options

	headers:
		X-Powered-By: MyCMS       # sends custom HTTP header

	csp:                          # Content Security Policy
		script-src: [
			nonce                 # for browsers that support CSP2
			self, unsafe-inline   # for browsers that support CSP1
		]

	cspReportOnly:                # Content Security Policy Report Only
		default-src: self
		report-uri: 'https://my-report-uri-endpoint'
```

For security reasons Nette Framework sends HTTP header `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` by default, so that the page can be embedded in iframe only from pages on the same domain. This behavior may be unwanted in certain situations (for example if you are developing a facebook application). You can override this setting by `frames: true`, `frames: http://allowed-host.com` or `frames: false`.

In example, we set `Content-Security-Policy` & `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` headers. For more informations see [CSP documentation |http://content-security-policy.com].


HTTP Proxies
============

You can define your HTTP proxy, so that HTTP request's remote address and remote host will be correct.

```neon
	http:
		proxy: 127.0.0.1  # IP address, range, hostname or array of these values
```


Latte
=====

You can turn on and off XHTML rendering mode and register custom [Latte |latte:] tags. Custom tags may be passed either as a class name or as a service reference. The default called method is `install`, you may change it by appending a double colon and a custom method name.

```neon
	latte:
		xhtml: true  # default is no
		macros:
			- App\MyLatteMacros::register         # static method, classname or callable
			- @App\MyLatteMacrosFactory           # service with install method
			- @App\MyLatteMacrosFactory::register # service with register method

		templateClass: App\MyTemplateClass        # default is Nette\Bridges\ApplicationLatte\Template

	services:
		- App\MyLatteMacrosFactory
```


Mailing
=======

Default mailer is `SendmailMailer`. By setting `smtp` you activate `SmtpMailer`.

```neon
	mail:
		smtp: true  # use SmtpMailer instead of SendmailMailer
		# optional settings
		host: ...
		port: ...
		username: ...
		password: ...
		secure: # possible values are ssl, tls or null
		timeout: ...
```


Routing
=======

Routes are typically defined in RouterFactory, such class [can be found in a sandbox](https://github.com/nette/sandbox/blob/v3.0/app/Router/RouterFactory.php#L17-L22).
However, we can also define them in the configuration file:

```neon
routing:
	routes:
		'detail/<id>': Admin:Home:default
		'<presenter>/<action>': Front:Home:default
```

Other settings:

```neon
routing:
	debugger: false  # turns off the panel in the Debugger bar
	cache: true  # serializes the router into the DI container
```


Session
=======

By default session will expire in a moment when a browser window is closed. Change the expiration time as follows:

```neon
	session:
		expiration: 14 days
```

Automatic session start:

```neon
	session:
		autoStart: true # default is 'smart'
```

Default `autoStart: smart` is recommended. It automatically starts the session only if it already exists.

If you're using a shared hosting, it's suitable to use a custom directory for storing files with session relations:

```neon
	session:
		savePath: "%tempDir%/sessions"
```

In this case, `%tempDir%` will be replaced by value you set in `$configurator->setTempDirectory()` in `Bootstrap.php`.

If you want to extend the validity of a session (or authentication) for subdomains, let's set just another cookie parameters:

```neon
	session:
		cookieDomain: 'example.com'
```

If you want to show session data in Debug bar:

```neon
	session:
		debugger: true
```

You can set all PHP [directives |http://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php] (in camelCase format) and also [readAndClose |https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-start.php#refsect1-function.session-start-parameters].


Tracy Debugger
==============

You can configure some [Tracy | tracy:] parameters and set up panels in the Debugger bar.

```neon
	tracy:
		# if error has occurred the notification is send to this email
		email: dev@example.com
		fromEmail: robot@example.com

		# for sending emails, it uses a mailer defined in the configuration. Since Tracy version 2.5.
		netteMailer: true

		# In Development mode, you will see notice or error warnings as BlueScreen
		strictMode: true

		# displays silent (@) error messages
		scream: true

		# link format to open in the editor
		editor: editor: // open /? file =% file & line =% line

		# path to a browser that will automatically open the logged BlueScreen in CLI mode
		browser: ...

		# for which error levels (E_WARNING, E_ALL, ...) BlueScreen is logged
		logSeverity:

		# path to template with custom page for error 500
		errorTemplate: ...

		# displays the Debugger Bar at the bottom of the page
		showBar: true

		# maximum string length of dump()
		maxLength: 150

		# how deep will list the dump()
		maxDepth: 3

		# displays the location where dump () was called
		showLocation: false

		editorMapping:
			# original: new
			/var/www/html: /data/web
			/home/web: /srv/html

		# appends bars to Debugger Bar
		bar:
			- Nette\Bridges\DITracy\ContainerPanel
			- IncludePanel
			- XDebugHelper('myIdeKey')
			- MyPanel(@MyService)

		# append panels to BlueScreen
		blueScreen:
			- DoctrinePanel::renderException
```

Low-level Modifications
=======================

All these settings affect the contents of the DI container and the system services it creates. All these services can still be changed to a low-level. For instance, we can change class of service `application.application`, which is by default `Nette\Application\Application`:

```neon
services:
	application.application:
		factory: MyApplication
		alteration: true
```

The `alteration` flag is informative and says we only modify an existing service.

We can also add setup:

```neon
services:
	application.application:
		factory: MyApplication
		alteration: true
		setup:
			- $onStartup = [@resource::init]
```

You can also remove the service from the container:

```neon
services:
	cache.journal: false
```


Services
========

The configuration file is place where we add definitions of our own services in section `services`. See the [DI: Services Configuration |di-configuration] chapter for a detailed description.

For example, this is definition of service named `database` which is `PDO` instance:

```neon
services:
	database: PDO('mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test', root, password)
```



More extensions
===============

Using extensions, the configuration file can be enhanced by additional sections through which we can configure additional components or modify the DI container.

```neon
extensions:
	dibi: Dibi\Bridges\Nette\DibiExtension22

dibi:
	host: localhost
```

Nette has a several extensions, e.g. [PhpExtension |di-builtin-extensions#phpextension], [DecoratorExtension |di-builtin-extensions#decoratorextension], [InjectExtension |di-builtin-extensions#injectextension], you can learn more about them in [DI: Built-in Container Extensions |di-builtin-extensions].
