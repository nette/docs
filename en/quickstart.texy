After the first two chapters you will have your own working blog and you'll be ready to publish your awesome posts, although the features will be pretty much limited after completing these two chapters. To make things nicer for your users, you should also read the following chapters and keep improving your application.

You can find the [complete application on GitHub |https://github.com/nette/tutorial-quickstart].

This QuickStart was written for Nette Framework 2.4.0 and PHP 5.6 or newer. Check out your version.
