Always update gradually, so not from Nette 2.4 to 3.1, but first to 3.0 and then to 3.1.

Before testing we recommend to disable reporting `E_USER_DEPRECATED` and allow it when everything will work:

```php
$configurator->enableTracy();
error_reporting(~E_USER_DEPRECATED); // note ~ before E_USER_DEPRECATED
```

The easiest way to increase the package versions in the `composer.json` file to the current one is to use the script [composer-frontline.php|https://gist.github.com/dg/734bebf55cf28ad6a5de1156d3099bff]. Run it in the directory where the `composer.json` file is located, using:

```shell
php composer-frontline.php
```
