Requirements Checker
********************

.[perex]
You will need **PHP version 7.1.0 or higher** to run Nette Framework 3.0. Also, your server will have to comply with required configuration of PHP.

Requirements Checker is tool bundled with application example known as [Sandbox|https://github.com/nette/sandbox], which checks server configuration and tells you, whether you can use this framework or not.

You can download Nette Framework [manually |www:download] (package contains Sandbox), but the recommended way is to use [Composer |/composer]:

```shell
composer create-project nette/sandbox
```

Requirements Checker is located in folder `/checker` of Sandbox, so type URL to web browser i.e. `http://localhost/sandbox/www/checker`. Now you will find if your server meets minimal requirements.

Green message with "Congratulations!" is self explaining tells if you can use Nette right away!
