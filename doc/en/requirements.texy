Nette Framework Requirements
****************************

.[perex]
You will need **PHP version 5.3.1 or higher** to run Nette Framework. Also, your server will have to comply with required configuration of PHP.

Requirements Checker
====================

Requirements Checker is bundled with Nette Framwork, so by downloading framework you will also get Requirements Checker tool, which checks server configuration and tells you, whether you can use this framework or not.

First, download and extract Nette Framework. Copy `checker.php` and `assets` directory from `tools/Requirements-Checker` to your webserver. Afterwards just run the script from your browser by typing url to checker.php script (in example http://example.com/checker/checker.php). Now you will find if your server meets minimal requirements.

Green message with "Congratulations!" is self explaining tells if you can use Nette right away!
