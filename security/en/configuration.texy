Configuring Access Control
**************************

.[perex]
Overview of configuration options for the Nette Security.

If you are not using the whole framework, but only this library, read [how to load the configuration|bootstrap:].

You can define a list of users in the configuration to create a [simple authenticator|authentication] (`Nette\Security\SimpleAuthenticator`). Because passwords are readable in the configuration, this solution is for testing purposes only.

```neon
security:
	# shows user panel in Tracy Bar?
	debugger: ...  # (bool) defaults to true

	users:
		# name: password
		johndoe: secret123

		# name, password, role and other data available in the identity
		janedoe:
			password: secret123
			roles: [admin]
			data: ...
```

You can also define roles and resources to create a basis for [authorizer|authorization] (`Nette\Security\Permission`):

```neon
security:
	roles:
		guest:
		registered: [guest]  # registered inherits from guest
		admin: [registered]  # and admin inherits from registered

	resources:
		article:
		comment: [article]   # resource inherits from article
		poll:
```


User Storage
------------

You can configure how to store information about the logged in user:

```neon
security:
	authentication:
		# after how long of inactivity the user will be logged out
		expiration: 30 minutes        # (string) default is not set

		# where to store information about the logged in user
		storage: session              # (session|cookie) default is session
```

If you choose `cookie` as your repository, you can also set the following options:

```neon
security:
	authentication:
		# name of cookie
		cookieName: userId            # (string) výchozí je userid

		# which hosts are allowed to receive the cookie
		cookieDomain: 'example.com'   # (string|domain)

		# restrictions when accessing cross-origin request
		cookieSamesite: None          # (Strict|Lax|None) defaults to Lax
```

These services are added to the DI container:

| `security.authenticator` | [api:Nette\Security\Authenticator] | [authenticator |authentication]
| `security.authorizator` | [api:Nette\Security\Authorizator] | [authorizer |authorization]
| `security.passwords` | [api:Nette\Security\Passwords] | [password hashing |passwords]
