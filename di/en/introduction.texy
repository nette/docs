Dependency Injection
********************

.[perex]
This chapter introduces you to the basic programming practices that underpin the entire Nette framework and that you should follow when writing your own applications. These are the basics needed to write clean, understandable, and maintainable code.

If you learn and follow these rules, the framework will be there for you every step of the way. It will handle routine tasks for you and make you as comfortable as possible so you can focus on the logic itself.

The principles we will show here are quite simple. You have nothing to worry about.


Remember your First Program?
----------------------------

We have no idea what language you wrote it in, but if it were PHP, it would probably look something like this:

```php
function addition($a, $b)
{
	return $a + $b;
}

echo addition(23, 1); // prints 24
```

A few trivial lines of code, yet so many key concepts are hidden in them. We see that there are variables. That code is broken down into smaller units, which are functions, for example. That we pass them input arguments and they return results. All that's missing are conditions and loops.

The fact that we pass input to a function and it returns a result is a perfectly understandable concept that is used in other fields, such as mathematics.

A function has a signature, which consists of its name, a list of parameters and their types, and finally the type of return value. As users, we are interested in the signature; we usually don't need to know anything about the internal implementation.

Now imagine that the signature of a function looks like this:

```php
function addition($x)
```

A addition with one parameter? That's weird... How about this?

```php
function addition()
```

That's really weird, isn't it? How do you think the function is used?

```php
echo addition(); // what does it prints?
```

Looking at such code, we are confused. Not only a beginner would not understand it, even a skilled programmer would not understand such code.

Wondering what such a function would actually look like inside? Where would it get the addends? It would probably get them *somehow* on its own, like this:

```php
function addition()
{
	$a = Input::get('a');
	$b = Input::get('b');
	return $a + $b;
}
```

It turns out that there are hidden bindings to other functions (or static methods) in the body of the function, and to find out where the addends actually come from, we have to dig further.


Not this Way!
-------------

The design we have just shown is the essence of many negative features:

- the function signature pretended that it didn't need addends, which confused us
- we have no idea how to make the function calculate with two other numbers
- we had to look into the code to see where it takes the addends
- we discovered hidden bindings
- to fully understand, we need to explore these bindings as well

And is it even the job of the addition function to procure inputs? Of course it isn't.  Its responsibility is only to add.


We don't want to encounter such code, and we certainly don't want to write it. The remedy is simple: go back to basics and just use parameters:


```php
function addition($a, $b)
{
	return $a + $b;
}
```


Rule #1: Use Parameters
-----------------------

The most important rule is: **all data that functions or classes need must be passed to them**.

If we break this rule, it will be impossible to make the code understandable, clean and sustainable.

If we follow it, we're on our way to code without hidden constraints. Towards code that is understandable not only to the author, but to anyone who reads it afterwards. Where everything is understandable from the signatures of functions and classes and there is no need to search for hidden secrets in the implementation.

This technique of passing arguments is technically called **dependency injection**.

(Don't confuse dependency injection with a "dependency injection container"; it is something radically different, and we'll cover containers in [next chapter|di-container].)


From Functions to Classes
-------------------------

And how do classes relate to this? A class is a more complex entity than a simple function, but rule #1 applies here as well. There are just [more ways to pass arguments|di-passing-dependencies]. For example, quite similar to the case of a function:

```php
class Math
{
	public function addition($a, $b)
	{
		return $a + $b;
	}
}

$math = new Math;
echo $math->addition(23, 1); // 24
```

Or by using other methods, or the constructor directly:

```php
class Addition
{
	private $a;
	private $b;

	public function __construct($a, $b)
	{
		$this->a = $a;
		$this->b = $b;
	}

	public function calculate()
	{
		return $this->a + $this->b;
	}

}

$addition = new Addition(23, 1);
echo $addition->calculate(); // 24
```

Both examples are completely in compliance with dependency injection.


Real-life Examples
------------------

In the real world, you won't write classes to add numbers. Let's move on to real-life examples.

Let's have a class `Article` representing a blog article:

```php
class Article
{
	public int $id;
	public string $title;
	public string $content;

	public function save()
	{
		// save the article to the database
	}
}
```

and the usage will be as follows:

```php
$article = new Article;
$article->title = '10 Things You Need to Know About Losing Weight';
$article->content = 'Every year millions of people in ...';
$article->save();
```

Method `save()` will store the article in a database table. Implementing it using [Nette Database |database] would be a piece of cake, if it weren't for one hitch: where does `Article` get the database connection, i.e. the class object `Nette\Database\Connection`?

It seems we have plenty of options. It can take it from some static variable. Or inherit from the class that will provide the database connection. Or take advantage of a so-called singleton. Or the so-called facades that are used in Laravel:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\DB;

class Article
{
	public int $id;
	public string $title;
	public string $content;

	public function save()
	{
		DB::insert(
			'INSERT INTO articles (title, content) VALUES (?, ?)',
			[$this->title, $this->content],
		);
	}
}
```

Great, we've solved the problem.

Or have we?

Recall [#rule #1: use parameters]: we have to pass all the data the class needs to them. Because if we don't, and we break the rule, we've started down the path to dirty code full of hidden bindings, incomprehensibility, and the result will be an application that's a pain to maintain and develop.

The user of class `Article` has no idea where method `save()` stores the article. In a database table? In which one, crisp or test? And how can this be changed?

The user has to look at how the method `save()` is implemented to find the use of the method `DB::insert()`. So he has to search further to find out how this method procures a database connection. And hidden bindings can form quite a long chain.

Hidden bindings, Laravel facades, or static variables are never present in clean, well-designed code. In clean and well-designed code, arguments are passed:

```php
class Article
{
	public function save(Nette\Database\Connection $db)
	{
		$db->query('INSERT INTO articles', [
			'title' => $this->title,
			'content' => $this->content,
		]);
	}
}
```

Even more practical, as we'll see next, is to use a constructor:

```php
class Article
{
	private $db;

	public function __construct(Nette\Database\Connection $db)
	{
		$this->db = $db;
	}

	public function save()
	{
		$this->db->query('INSERT INTO articles', [
			'title' => $this->title,
			'content' => $this->content,
		]);
	}
}
```

If you are going to write a class that requires a database, for example, don't figure out where to get it from, but let it be passed to you. Perhaps as a parameter to a constructor or other method. Declare dependencies. Expose them in the API of your class. You'll get understandable and predictable code.

How about this class that logs error messages:

```php
class Logger
{
	public function log(string $message)
	{
		$file = LOG_DIR . '/log.txt';
		file_put_contents($file, $message . "\n", FILE_APPEND);
	}
}
```

What do you think, did we follow [#rule #1: use parameters]?

We didn't.

The class *obtains* the key information, the directory containing the log file, from a constant.

See an example usage:

```php
$logger = new Logger;
$logger->log('The temperature is 23 °C');
$logger->log('The temperature is 10 °C');
```

Without knowing the implementation, could you answer the question where the messages are written? Would it suggest to you that the existence of the LOG_DIR constant is necessary for it to work? And would you be able to create a second instance that writes to a different location? Certainly not.

Let's fix the class:

```php
class Logger
{
	private $file;

	public function __construct(string $file)
	{
		$this->file = $file;
	}

	public function log(string $message)
	{
		file_put_contents($this->file, $message . "\n", FILE_APPEND);
	}
}
```

The class is now much clearer, more configurable and therefore more useful.

```php
$logger = new Logger('/path/to/log.txt');
$logger->log('The temperature is 15 °C');
```


But I don't Care!
-----------------

*"When I create an Article object and call save(), I don't want to deal with the database, I just want it to be saved to the one I have set in the configuration. "*

*"When I use Logger, I just want the message to be written, and I don't want to deal with where. Let the global settings be used. "*

These are correct comments.

As an example, let's take a class that sends out newsletters and logs how that went:

```php
class NewsletterDistributor
{
	public function distribute()
	{
		$logger = new Logger(/* ... */);
		try {
			$this->sendEmails();
			$logger->log('Emails have been sent out');

		} catch (Exception $e) {
			$logger->log('An error occurred during the sending');
			throw $e;
		}
	}
}
```

However, the new `Logger`, which no longer uses the `LOG_DIR` constant, requires the path to the file in the constructor. How to solve this? The `NewsletterDistributor` class doesn't care where the messages are written, it just wants to write them.

The solution is again [#rule #1: use parameters]: pass all the data the class needs to it.

So we pass the path to the log to the constructor, which we then use when creating the `Logger` object? No. Because the path is not the data that the `NewsletterDistributor` class needs; that's what `Logger` needs. The class needs the logger itself. And we're going to pass that:


```php
class NewsletterDistributor
{
	private $logger;

	public function __construct(Logger $logger)
	{
		$this->logger = $logger;
	}

	public function distribute()
	{
		try {
			$this->sendEmails();
			$this->logger->log('Emails have been sent out');

		} catch (Exception $e) {
			$this->logger->log('An error occurred during the sending');
			throw $e;
		}
	}
}
```

Now it is clear from the signatures of class `NewsletterDistributor` that logging is part of its functionality. And you have the option to replace the logger with another one.

While in the whole application we can be happy with a single instance of the logger and pass it wherever something is logged, it is different in the case of the `Article` class. We will want to create multiple instances of it. How to deal with the database dependency in the constructor? As an example, let's take a controller that is supposed to save an article to the database after submitting a form:

```php
class UserController extends Controller
{
	public function formSubmitted($data)
	{
		$article = new Article(/* ... */);
		$article->title = $data->title;
		$article->content = $data->content;
		$article->save();
	}
}
```

A possible solution is suggested: pass the database object to the `UserController` by the constructor and use `$article = new Article($this->db)`.

As in the previous case, this is not the correct practice. The database is not a `UserController` dependency, but an `Article` dependency. Moreover, the moment the constructor of the `Article` class is somehow changed (a new parameter is added), we will have to modify the code in all the places where instances are created.

The solution is factories.


Rule #2: Use Factories
----------------------

By removing the hidden bindings and passing all data as arguments, we get more configurable and flexible classes. Therefore, we still need something to create and configure those more flexible classes. We'll call it a factory.

The rule of thumb is: if a class has dependencies, leave the creation of their instances to the factory.

Factories are a smarter replacement for the `new` operator in the dependency injection world.


Factory
-------

A factory is a class that creates and configures objects. The factory that produces `Article` will be called `ArticleFactory` and its use in the controller will be as follows:

```php
class UserController extends Controller
{
	private $articleFactory;

	public function __construct(ArticleFactory $articleFactory)
	{
		$this->articleFactory = $articleFactory;
	}

	public function formSubmitted($data)
	{
		// let the factory create an object
		$article = $this->articleFactory->create();
		$article->title = $data->title;
		$article->content = $data->content;
		$article->save();
	}
}
```

A factory implementation might look like this:


```php
class ArticleFactory
{
	private $db;

	public function __construct(Nette\Database\Connection $db)
	{
		$this->db = $db;
	}

	/** @return Article */
	public function create()
	{
		return new Article($this->db);
	}
}
```

At this point, when the signature of the class constructor `Article` changes, the only part of the code that needs to react to this is the factory `ArticleFactory`. Any other code that works with `Article` objects, such as `UserController`, is unaffected.

You may be tapping your forehead right now wondering how we actually helped ourselves. The amount of code has grown and moved from the controller to a separate class. However, Nette DI has a hidden ace up its sleeve. It understands the concept of factories and can even [write such a service for us|di-factory]. So instead of the `ArticleFactory` class, we could just create an interface:

```php
interface ArticleFactory
{
	function create(): Article;
}
```

But we're getting a little ahead of that now, we'll get to that in a minute.


Summary
-------

At the beginning of this chapter, we promised to demonstrate a simple principle of how to design applications. Although the principle itself is simple (give the classes the data they need), what follows from it requires more thought. Feel free to read this chapter several times.

Programmers who have thrown out old habits and started using dependency injection consistently consider this a pivotal moment in their professional lives. It opened up a world of clear and sustainable applications.

Now we will see what [Dependency Injection Container|di-container] is.
