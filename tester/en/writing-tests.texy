Writing Tests
*************

Each test is an ordinary PHP script. Even it seems common, a big potential is hidden in it. We can step through the test in IDE or load it via web browser.


Skipping tests
==============
Some tests can run only under certain circumstances. If these circumstances aren't met, we can skip the tests. For example, required OS type:

```php
if (defined('PHP_WINDOWS_VERSION_BUILD')) {
	Tester\Environment::skip('Requires UNIX.');
}
```

Test will be stopped and marked as `s` - skipped. Later we find out how to skip the test using the `@skip` annotation.



Tips
====
- It is not good practice to use `exit()` and `die()` to end test with a fail message. For example `exit('Error in connection')` ends a test with exit code 0 (zero) and it means success. Always use `echo 'Error in connection'` followed by `exit(1)`.
