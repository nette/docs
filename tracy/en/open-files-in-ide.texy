How to open a file in editor from Tracy?
****************************************

.[perex]
When error page is displayed, you can click on file names and they will open in your editor with the cursor on the corresponding line. Files can also be created (action `create file`) or bug fixed in them (action `fix it`). In order to do this, you need to configure the browser and the system.

If you do not change variable `Tracy\Debugger::$editor`, the Tracy will open the files by using the URL having this format: `editor://open/?file=%file&line=%line`, i.e. using `editor://` protocol. You need to register a handler in your system, which can be any executable file able to process passed URL.


Windows
=======

1. Download the appropriate files "from the Tracy repository":https://github.com/nette/tracy/tree/master/tools/open-in-editor/windows to disk.

2. Edit `open-editor.js` and uncomment or edit the path to your editor in `settings`:

/--code js
var settings = {

	// PhpStorm
	editor: '"C:\\Program Files\\JetBrains\\PhpStorm 2018.1.2\\bin\\phpstorm64.exe" --line %line% "%file%"',
	title: 'PhpStorm',

	// NetBeans
	// editor: '"C:\\Program Files\\NetBeans 8.1\\bin\\netbeans.exe" "%file%:%line%" --console suppress',

	// Sublime Text 2
	// editor: '"C:\\Program Files\\Sublime Text 2\\sublime_text.exe" "%file%:%line%"',

	....
}

....
\--

Be careful and keep the double slashes in the paths.

3. Register the handler for `editor://` protocol in the system.

This is done by running `install.cmd`. **You need to run it as Administrator.** The `open-editor.js` script will now serve the `editor://` protocol.


Linux
=====

1. Download the appropriate files "from the Tracy repository":https://github.com/nette/tracy/tree/master/tools/open-in-editor/linux to directory `~/bin`.

2. Edit `open-editor.sh` and uncomment or edit the path to your editor in variable `editor`:

/--
#!/bin/bash

# Emacs
#editor='emacs +$LINE "$FILE"'

# gVim
#editor='gvim +$LINE "$FILE"'

# gEdit
#editor='gedit +$LINE "$FILE"'

# Pluma
#editor='pluma +$LINE "$FILE"'

...
\--

Make it executable:

/--
chmod +x ~/bin/open-editor.sh
\--

If the editor you are using is not installed from the package, the binary will probably not have a path in `$PATH`. This can be easily corrected. In the `~/bin` directory, create a symlink on the editor binary. [note]


3. Register the handler for `editor://` protocol in the system.

This is done by running `install.sh`. The `open-editor.js` script will now serve the `editor://` protocol.


Mac OS X
========

If you use TextMate editor, or another supporting special URL, just configure it in $editor variable:

/--php
// PhpStorm
Tracy\Debugger::$editor = 'phpstorm://open?file=%file&line=%line';
// TextMate
Tracy\Debugger::$editor = 'txmt://open/?url=file://%file&line=%line';
// MacVim
Tracy\Debugger::$editor = 'mvim://open/?url=file://%file&line=%line';
\--

Unfortunately, actions `create file` or `fix it` do not work on Mac OS X.

Troubleshooting
===============

- in Firefox you may need to [allow |http://kb.mozillazine.org/Register_protocol#Firefox_3.5_and_above] custom protocol execution in about:config by setting `network.protocol-handler.expose.editor` to `false` and `network.protocol-handler.expose-all` to `true`. It should be allowed by default however.
- If it's not all working immediately, don't panic. Try to refresh the page, restart browser or computer. That should help.
- Input Error: There is no script engine for file extension ".js" Maybe you associated ".js" file to another app, not JScript engine. To fix, see [here|http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/230/1/Error-There-is-no-script-engine-for-file-extension-when-running-js-files.html]
