Getting Started
***************

.[perex]
Meet Nette Framework and create your first application.

The very first thing you should do is check if your server satisfies the [requirements|/requirements] of Nette Framework. It should most likely be fine, but just to be sure we won't start with broken environment.

You can download Nette Framework [manually |www:download], but the recommended way of starting a new project is using [Composer |/composer]. If you don't know Composer, you should definitely start with that. It's really simple and useful tool, check out [their documentation |http://getcomposer.org/doc/].

With Composer, you can download and install the application skeleton known as Sandbox including Nette Framework very easily. To do so, find your web root directory (e.g. `/var/www` or `C:\InetPub`) in your command line and execute the following command:

/--
composer create-project nette/sandbox nette-blog
\--

Sandbox will be downloaded into `nette-blog` directory.

.[note]
If you couldn't use Composer, [download |www:download] and extract the archive. The entire framework is located in the `Nette` folder, there is also a minified version in Nette-minified/nette.phar. [API reference|https://api.nette.org] is available in the `API-reference` directory. In the `examples` directory, there is a set of simple, directly executable examples, the `tools` directory contains some useful tools and finally, the `sandbox`: copy it to root directory of web server and rename to `nette-blog`.

If you're developing on Mac OS X or Linux (or any other Unix based system), you need to configure write privileges to the web server.

/--
cd nette-blog && chmod -R a+rw temp log
\--


The Welcome Page
====

At this moment, the welcome page of the Sandbox should be running. Try it by opening your browser and going to the following URL:

/--
http://localhost/nette-blog/www/
\--

and you should see the Nette Framework welcome page:

The application works and you can now start making changes to it.


Sandbox's Content
====

Sandbox has the following structure:

/--pre
<b>www/</b>                      ← web root directory
└── <b>nette-blog/</b>
    ├── <b>app/</b>              ← application directory
    │   ├── <b>config/</b>       ← configuration files
    │   ├── <b>forms/</b>        ← form classes
    │   ├── <b>model/</b>        ← model layer classes
    │   ├── <b>presenters/</b>   ← presenter classes
    │   │   └── <b>templates/</b>← templates
    │   ├── <b>router/</b>       ← configuration of URL addresses
    │   └── <b>bootstrap.php</b> ← boot file
    ├── <b>bin/</b>              ← utilities folder
    ├── <b>log/</b>              ← here you can find error message logs
    ├── <b>temp/</b>             ← place for temporary files (cache, sessions, etc.)
    ├── <b>test/</b>             ← directory for unit tests
    │
    ├── <b>vendor/</b>           ← libraries for your application
    │   └── <b>nette/</b>        ← like your favorite framework :-)
    │
    └── <b>www/</b>              ← local web root - this is the only directory accessible from the web
\--

Directory `www` is supposed to store images, JavaScript, CSS, and other publicly available files. This is the only directory directly accessible from the browser, so you can point the root directory of your web server here (you can configure it in Apache, but let’s do it later as it’s not important right now).

The most important directory for you is `app/`. You can find `bootstrap.php` file there, which loads the framework and configures the application. It activates [autoloading |/auto-loading] and sets up the [debugger |tracy:] and [routes |/routing].



Cleanup
=======

The sandbox contains some sample code. You should probably start by removing it before you write your own code - feel free to delete the `app/presenters/templates/Homepage/default.latte` file. We’ll add our own content in a minute.

Tracy (debugger)
=====

An extremely important tool for development is [a debugger called Tracy |tracy:]. Try to make some errors in your `app/presenters/HomepagePresenter.php` file (e.g. remove a letter from the word `class` in code) and see what happens. A red-screen page will pop up with understandable error description.

[* debugger-620.png .(debugger screen) *]

Tracy will significantly help you while hunting down errors. Also note the floating Debugger bar in the bottom right corner, which informs you about important runtime data.

[* quick-tracy-info.png *]

In the production mode, Tracy is, of course, disabled and does not reveal any sensitive information. All error are saved into `log/` directory instead. Just try it out. In `app/bootstrap.php`, find the following piece of code, uncomment the line and change the method call parameter to `FALSE`, so it looks like this:

/--php
// Enable Nette Debugger for error visualization & logging
$configurator->setDebugMode(FALSE);
$configurator->enableDebugger(__DIR__ . '/../log');
\--

After refreshing the web page, the red-screen page will be replaced with user-friendly message:

[* server-error-620.png .(error screen) *]

Now look into the `log/` directory. You can find the error log there (in exception.log file) and also the page with error message (saved in an HTML file with name starting with `exception`).

Comment line `// $configurator->setDebugMode(FALSE);` again. Tracy automatically enables debug mode on `localhost` environment and disables it elsewhere.

Now, we can fix the bug and continue designing our application.
