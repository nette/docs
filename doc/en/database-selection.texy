Database: Selection
===================

[api:Nette\Database\Table\Selection] allows you to select and filter all table rows. Selection power is hidden in writing conditions, which automatically creates needed table joins. You will be pleased not to write table joins anymore. .[perex]

Filtering
---------
Let's go through the basic Selection API. You can specify basic conditions for your selection by calling [where() |api:Nette\Database\Table\Selection::where()] method. Substitute all values by `?`.

/--code php
$selection->where('name = ?', $name);
$selection->where('born > ?', $datetime);
\--

Nette\Database can automatically add needed operators for passed values:
/--code php
$name = 'Jon Snow';
$ids  = array(1, 2, 3);
$null = NULL;

$selection->where('name', $name);  // name = 'Jon Snow'
$selection->where('id',   $ids);   // id IN (1, 2, 3)
$selection->where('born', $null);  // born IS NULL
\--

Calling `where()` method multiple times joins the conditions by `AND` operator. If you need `OR` operator, write your condition at once.

/--code php
// id = 1 AND name = 'Jon Snow'
$selection->where('id', 1)->where('name', $name);
$selection->where('id = ? AND name = ?', 1, $name);

// id = 1 OR name = 'Jon Snow'
$selection->where('id = ? OR name = ?', 1, $name);
\--

Be careful! If you do not provide a column operator, the value could have modify the intended behavior. .[warning]

You can provide placeholder even without column operator. This calls are almost the same.
/--code php
$selection->where('id = ? OR id = ?', 1, 2);
$selection->where('id ? OR id ?', 1, 2);
\--

Selection correctly handles also negative conditions, works for arrays too.

/--code php
$selection->where('NOT id', 1);
$selection->where('id NOT', 1); // the same

$ids = array();
$selection->where('id', $ids);          // id IS NULL AND FALSE
$selection->where('id NOT', $ids);      // id IS NULL OR FALSE
$selection->where('NOT (id ?)', $ids);  // NOT (id IS NULL AND FALSE)

// this will throws an exception, this syntax is not supported
$selection->where('NOT id ?', $ids);
\--


Filtering by another table value .[#toc-joining-key]
--------------------------------

Quite often you need filter results by some condition which involves another database table. These types of condition require table join. However, you don't need write them anymore.

Let's say, you need to get all book which has author whose name is "Jon". All you need to write is just the "joining key" of the relation and column name in the joined table. "Joining key" is derived from the column which refers to table you want to join. Our example (see db schema) has column `author_id`, so we can use just part of it - `author`. `name` is column in `author` table. You can also create condition for book translator (which is connected by `translator_id` column).

/--code php
$selection = $context->table('book');
$selection->where('author.name LIKE ?', '%Jon%');
$selection->where('translator.name', 'David Grudl');
\--

The "joining key" logic is driven by implementation of [IConventions |api:Nette\Database\IConventions]. We encourage to use [DiscoveredConventions |api:Nette\Database\Conventions\DiscoveredConventions], which analyze your foreign keys and allows you easily work with these relationships.

The relationship between book and its author is 1:N. The reverse relationships is also possible. We call it **backjoin**. Take a look on another example. We would like to fetch all authors, who has written more than 3 books. To make the join reverse we use `:` (colon). Colon means that the joined relationship means "hasMany" (and it's quite logic, two dots is more than one). Unfortunately, Selection isn't smart enough, so we must help with the aggregation and provide some `GROUP BY` statement, also the condition must be written as the `HAVING` statement.

/--code php
$selection = $context->table('author');
$selection->group('author.id')
          ->having('COUNT(:book.id) > 3');
\--

Maybe you have noticed that the joining expression refers to the book, but it's not clear, if we are joining over `author_id` or `translator_id`. In the example above Selection joins over the `author_id` column, because Selection have found match with the source table - table `author`. If there wouldn't be a match and would there be more possibilities, Nette would throw [AmbiguousReferenceKeyException |api:Nette\Database\Conventions\AmbiguousReferenceKeyException].

To make join over `translator_id`, just provide optional "parameter" into "joining expression".

/--code php
$selection = $context->table('author');
$selection->group('author.id')
          ->having('COUNT(:book(translator).id) > 3')
\--

Let's take a look on some more difficult joining expression.

We would like to find all authors who have written something about PHP. All books have tags so we should select those authors who have written any book with the PHP tag.

/--code php
$selection = $context->table('author');
$selection->where(':book:book_tags.tag.name', 'PHP')
          ->group('author.id')
          ->having('COUNT(:book:book_tags.tag.id) > 0');
\--




API
-------------
See possibilities how to filter and restrict rows Selection:
.[wide]

| `$table->where($where[, $param[, ...]])` | Set WHERE
| `$table->order($columns)` | Set ORDER BY, can be expression `('column DESC, id DESC')`
| `$table->select($columns)` | Set retrieved columns, can be expression `('col, MD5(col) AS hash')`
| `$table->limit($limit[, $offset])` | Set LIMIT and OFFSET
| `$table->group($columns)` | Set GROUP BY
| `$table->having($having)` | Set HAVING

You can use fluent interface, for example `$table->where(...)->order(...)->limit(...)`. More `where` conditions are connected with the `AND` operator. For `OR` operator use just one `where()` call:

/--code php
$table->where('born > ? OR born IS NULL', $datetime);
\--

Possible [where() |api:Nette\Database\Table\Selection::where()] method arguments:

.[wide]
| `$table->where("field", $value)` | field = $value
| `$table->where("field", NULL)` | field IS NULL
| `$table->where("field > ?", $val)` | field > $val
| `$table->where("field", array(1, 2))` | field IN (1, 2)
| `$table->where("field", $conn->table($tableName))` | field IN (SELECT $primary FROM $tableName)
| `$table->where("field", $conn->table($tableName)->select('col'))` | field IN (SELECT col FROM $tableName)

Aggregate queries can also be created:

.[wide]
| `$table->count("*")` | Get number of rows
| `$table->count("DISTINCT $column")` | Get number of distinct values
| `$table->min($column)` | Get minimum value
| `$table->max($column)` | Get maximum value
| `$table->sum($column)` | Get the sum of all values
| `$table->aggregation("GROUP_CONCAT($column)")` | Run any aggregation function

Fetching data:

.[wide]
| `foreach ($table as $id => $row)` | Iterate all rows in result
| `$row = $table->get($id)` | Get single row with ID $id from table
| `$row = $table->fetch()` | Get next row from the result
| `$array = $table->fetchPairs($key, $value)` | Fetch all values to associative array
| `$array = $table->fetchPairs($key)` | Fetch all rows to associative array
| `count($table)` | Get number of rows in result set
