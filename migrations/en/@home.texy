Upgrade Guide
*************

- [from Nette 3.1 to 4.0 |to-4-0]
- [from Nette 3.0 to 3.1 |to-3-1]
- [from Nette 2.4 to 3.0 |to-3-0]
- [from Nette 2.3 to 2.4 |to-2-4]
- [from Nette 2.2 to 2.3 |to-2-3]
- [from Nette 2.1 to 2.2 |to-2-2]
- [from Nette 2.0 to 2.1 |to-2-1]


Always update gradually, so not from Nette 2.4 to 3.1, but first to 3.0 and then to 3.1.

Before testing we recommend to disable reporting `E_USER_DEPRECATED` and allow it when everything will work:

```php
$configurator->enableTracy();
error_reporting(~E_USER_DEPRECATED); // note ~ before E_USER_DEPRECATED
```


Upgrade to the Latest Versions
------------------------------

The easiest way to increase the package versions in the `composer.json` file to the latest one is to use the script [composer-frontline.php|https://gist.github.com/dg/734bebf55cf28ad6a5de1156d3099bff]. Run it in the directory where the `composer.json` file is located, using:

```shell
php composer-frontline.php
```
