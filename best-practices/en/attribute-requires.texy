How to Use the `#[Requires]` Attribute
**************************************

.[perex]
When writing a web application, you often encounter the need to restrict access to certain parts of your application. Perhaps you want some requests to only be able to send data via a form (thus using the POST method) or to be accessible only to AJAX calls. In Nette Framework 3.2, a new tool has been introduced that allows you to set such restrictions elegantly and clearly: the `#[Requires]` attribute.

An attribute is a special marker in PHP that you add before the definition of a class or method. Since it is essentially a class, you need to include the `use` clause to make the following examples work:

```php
use Nette\Application\Attributes\Requires;
```

You can use the `#[Requires]` attribute with the presenter class itself and on these methods:

- `action<Action>()`
- `render<View>()`
- `handle<Signal>()`
- `createComponent<Name>()`

The last two methods also apply to components, so you can use the attribute with them as well.

If the conditions specified by the attribute are not met, an HTTP 4xx error is triggered.


HTTP Methods
------------

You can specify which HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, etc.) are allowed for access. For example, if you want to allow access only by submitting a form, set:

```php
class AdminPresenter extends Nette\Application\UI\Presenter
{
	#[Requires(methods: 'POST')]
	public function actionDelete(int $id): void
	{
	}
}
```

Why should you use POST instead of GET for state-changing actions and how to do it? [Read the guide |post-links].

You can specify a method or an array of methods. A special case is the value `'*'`, which allows all methods, something presenters [do not allow by default for security reasons |application:presenters#HTTP Method Check].


AJAX Calls
----------

If you want a presenter or method to be accessible only for AJAX requests, use:

```php
#[Requires(ajax: true)]
class AjaxPresenter extends Nette\Application\UI\Presenter
{
}
```


Same Origin
-----------

To enhance security, you can require that the request be made from the same domain. This prevents the [CSRF vulnerability |nette:vulnerability-protection#Cross-Site Request Forgery CSRF]:

```php
#[Requires(sameOrigin: true)]
class SecurePresenter extends Nette\Application\UI\Presenter
{
}
```

For `handle<Signal>()` methods, access from the same domain is required automatically. So, if you want to allow access from any domain, specify:

```php
#[Requires(sameOrigin: false)]
public function handleList(): void
{
}
```


Access via Forward
------------------

Sometimes it is useful to restrict access to a presenter so that it is only available indirectly, for example, using the `forward()` or `switch()` methods from another presenter. This is how error-presenters are protected, for instance, to prevent them from being triggered from a URL:

```php
#[Requires(forward: true)]
class ForwardedPresenter extends Nette\Application\UI\Presenter
{
}
```

In practice, it is often necessary to mark certain views that can only be accessed based on logic in the presenter. Again, so that they cannot be opened directly:

```php
class ProductPresenter extends Nette\Application\UI\Presenter
{

	public function actionDefault(int $id): void
	{
		$product = $this->facade->getProduct($id);
		if (!$product) {
			$this->setView('notfound');
		}
	}

	#[Requires(forward: true)]
	public function renderNotFound(): void
	{
	}
}
```


Specific Actions
----------------

You can also restrict certain code, like creating a component, to be accessible only for specific actions in the presenter:

```php
class EditDeletePresenter extends Nette\Application\UI\Presenter
{
	#[Requires(actions: ['add', 'edit'])]
	public function createComponentPostForm()
	{
	}
}
```

In the case of a single action, there's no need to write an array: `#[Requires(actions: 'default')]`


Custom Attributes
-----------------

If you want to use the `#[Requires]` attribute repeatedly with the same settings, you can create your own attribute that inherits `#[Requires]` and configures it according to your needs.

For example, `#[SingleAction]` allows access only through the `default` action:

```php
#[Attribute]
class SingleAction extends Nette\Application\Attributes\Requires
{
	public function __construct()
	{
		parent::__construct(actions: 'default');
	}
}

#[SingleAction]
class SingleActionPresenter extends Nette\Application\UI\Presenter
{
}
```

Or `#[RestMethods]` will allow access via all HTTP methods used for the REST API:

```php
#[Attribute]
class RestMethods extends Nette\Application\Attributes\Requires
{
	public function __construct()
	{
		parent::__construct(methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE']);
	}
}

#[RestMethods]
class ApiPresenter extends Nette\Application\UI\Presenter
{
}
```


Conclusion
----------

The `#[Requires]` attribute gives you great flexibility and control over how your web pages are accessed. Using simple, yet powerful rules, you can enhance the security and proper functioning of your application. As you can see, using attributes in Nette can not only simplify your work but also secure it.
