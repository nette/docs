Nette Packages & Installation
*****************************

Nette is a full-featured PHP framework consisting of a set of independent packages.
You can download and use these packages independently of the rest of the framework.

To download and install the individual packages, use [Composer |doc:best-practices/composer]:

All packages at once can be added as follows:

```shell
composer require nette/nette
```
