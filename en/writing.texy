It will be great, if you participate in making or translating documentation. How?

For editing documents you must have permission to ask you [here in the forum | http://forum.nette.org/cs/5791-chci-ziskat-pravo-editovat-dokumentaci]. If you are not sure about anything, write to the [section Documentation | http://forum.nette.org/cs/f32-dokumentace].


How do I write?
---------------

The documentation is intended primarily for people who are only familiar with the topic. Be aware all the time writing. The text must be designed to lead readers from simple to complex. In the introduction, there is no need to say about the topic all the details (and certainly not through aggressive `. [Note]` notes), do not want to overwhelm readers.

They appreciate the brevity. Whatever you write, truncate at the half. When you succeed, then shorten it by half again.

They appreciate the ability to explain the matter. Before you start writing, try to explain the theme of your colleague (or dog) and then just let the work.


1) Learn to [wiki: syntax], which you can try to [sandbox | wiki: sandbox] where you can not cause any harm
2) Keep [Coding Standard]
3) All write for version Nette Framework 2.0 and PHP 5.3 (with the exception of documentation for 0.9)
4) The differences versions 5.2 and 5.3 in the actual framework (namespace are not counted), we write as a warning (`. [Warning]`)
6) The names, including namespaces, classes give the first mention, then no namespace
7) Save highlighter all kinds, from the bold frames `. [Note]`
8) In the text file rather "myka" and we are polite
9) Perex is a brief teaser on, do not confuse it with the first paragraph
10) try to format the code so that the sliders do not show
11) Source form of the site should be transparent, generous free line between paragraphs, titles, code, etc.


How to create a translation?
----------------------------

English documentation homepage is [ready | doc:homepage], it is needed to add content. It is at this point shows the translated through Google Translator, so do not confuse it. Probably the easiest way is to copy the source of Czech site and use it as a basis for the English site. The source code you can leave the pre-Google Translator to translate, but it is then necessary to modify the changes that will make the wiki syntax.

The translation should use simple vocabulary, because it is designed not only for native speakers, but for anyone.
