Writing Tests
*************

Each test is an ordinary PHP script. Even it seems common, a big potential is hidden in it. We can step through the test in IDE or load it via web browser.


Assertions
==========
In the example on "guide page":[guide#writing the tests] we used two assertions: `Assert::same()` and `Assert::exception()`. Now we introduce all other types and we explain how to be used. They are methods of the `Tester\Assert` class but for simplification, we use them further without namespace.


Assert::same($expected, $actual) .[method]
------------------------------------------
`$expected` must be the same as `$actual`, or must "fulfill expectations":[#expectations]. It is the same as PHP operator `===`.


Assert::notSame($expected, $actual) .[method]
---------------------------------------------
Opposite to `Assert::same()`.


Assert::equal($expected, $actual) .[method]
-------------------------------------------
`$expected` must be equal to `$actual`. Object identities and array keys order are ignored.


Assert::notEqual($expected, $actual) .[method]
----------------------------------------------
Opposite to `Assert::equal()`.


Assert::contains($needle, $actual) .[method]
--------------------------------------------
`$actual` must contain `$needle`. If `$actual` is string, it must contain `$needle` substring. If it is an array, it must contain `$needle` item.


Assert::notContains($needle, $actual) .[method]
-----------------------------------------------
Opposite to `Assert::contains()`.


Assert::true($value) .[method]
------------------------------
`$value` must be `true`, so `$value === true`.


Assert::truthy($value) .[method]
--------------------------------
`$value` must be truthy, so `$value == true`.


Assert::false($value) .[method]
-------------------------------
`$value` must be `false`, so `$value === false`.


Assert::falsey($value) .[method]
--------------------------------
`$value` must be falsey, so `$value == false`.


Assert::count($count, $value) .[method]
---------------------------------------
`$count` must be number of elements in `$value`. Countable is an array or an object implementing `Countable`.


Assert::null($value) .[method]
------------------------------
`$value` must be `null`, so `$value === null`.


Assert::nan($value) .[method]
-----------------------------
`$value` must be Not a Number.


Assert::type($type, $value) .[method]
-------------------------------------
`$value` must be of a given type. As `$type` we can use string:
- `array`
- `list` - same as the array but keys must start by zero and must be incremented by one
- `bool`
- `callable`
- `float`
- `int` or `integer`
- `null`
- `object`
- `resource`
- `scalar`
- `string`
- class name or object directly then must pass `$value instanceof $type`


Assert::exception($callable, $class, $message = null, $code = null) .[method]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
On `$callable` invocation an exception of `$class` instance must be thrown. If we pass `$message`, the message of the exception must match (see [Assert::match() |#assert-match]). And if we pass `$code`, code of the exception must be the same. For example, this test fails because message of the exception does not match:

```php
Assert::exception(function () {
	throw new App\InvalidValueException('Zero value');
}, App\InvalidValueException::class, 'Value is to low');
```

The `Assert::exception()` is unique by returning the thrown exception. So we can test a previous exception:

```php
$e = Assert::exception(function () {
	throw new MyException('Something is wrong', 0, new RuntimeException);
}, MyException::class, 'Something is wrong');

Assert::type(RuntimeException::class, $e->getPrevious());
```


Assert::error($callable, $type, $message = null) .[method]
----------------------------------------------------------
If we pass a class name as `$type`, this assertion behaves as absolutely same as `Assert::exception()`.

If `$type` is one of `E_...` constants, for example `E_WARNING`, the `$callable` must generate this error when invoked. And if we pass `$message` message of the error must match (see [Assert::match() |#assert-match]). For example:

```php
Assert::error(function () {
	$i++;
}, E_NOTICE, 'Undefined variable: i');
```

And the last possibility, if `$type` is an array the `$callable` must generate all expected errors. An example shows it best:

```php
Assert::error(function () {
	$a++;
	$b++;
}, [
	[E_NOTICE, 'Undefined variable: a'],
	[E_NOTICE, 'Undefined variable: b'],
]);
```


Assert::noError($callable) .[method]
------------------------------------
Checks that the function `$callable` does not throw any PHP warning/notice/error or exception. It is useful for testing a piece of code where is no other assertion.


Assert::match($pattern, $actual) .[method]
------------------------------------------
`$actual` must match to `$pattern`. We can use two pattern types:

We pass a regular expression as `$pattern`. To delimit it we must use `~` or `#`. Other delimiters are not supported. For example test where `$var` must contain only hexadecimal digits:

```php
Assert::match('#^[0-9a-f]$#i', $var);
```

The other variant is similar to string comparing but we can use some modifiers in `$pattern`:
- `%a%` one or more of anything except for the end of line characters
- `%a?%` zero or more of anything except for the end of line characters
- `%A%` one or more of anything including the end of line characters
- `%A?%` zero or more of anything including the end of line characters
- `%s%` one or more white space characters except for the end of line characters
- `%s?%` zero or more white space characters except for the end of line characters
- `%S%` one or more of characters except for the white space
- `%S?%` zero or more of characters except for the white space
- `%c%` a single character of any sort (except for the end of line)
- `%d%` one or more digits
- `%d?%` zero or more digits
- `%i%` signed integer value
- `%f%` floating point number
- `%h%` one or more HEX digits
- `%w%` one or more alphanumeric characters
- `%%` one % character

Examples:

```php
# Again, hexadecimal number test
Assert::match('%h%', $var);

# Generalized path to file and line number
Assert::match('Error in file %a% on line %i%', $errorMessage);
```


Assert::matchFile($file, $actual) .[method]
-------------------------------------------
The assertion is identical to [Assert::match() |#assert-match] but the pattern is loaded from `$file`. It is useful for very long strings testing. Test file stands readable.


Assert::fail($message, $actual = null, $expected = null) .[method]
------------------------------------------------------------------
This assertion always fails. It is just handy. We can optionally pass expected and actual values.


Expectations
------------
When comparing more complex structures, the assertions above may not be sufficient when some structure items are of random nature. For example some hashes or timestamps. In that case we can use `Tester\Expect` objects inside `$expected` parameter of `Assert::equal()` and `Assert::notEqual()` methods as following.

Let's suppose that we test a method that creates a new user and returns its attributes as an array.

```php
use Tester\Expect;

Assert::equal([
	'id' => 123,
	'username' => 'milo',
	'password' => Expect::match('%h%'),  # random string, hash, but must match some pattern
	'created_at' => Expect::type(DateTimeImmutable::class),  # check type only, not exact value
], User::create(123, 'milo', 'RandomPaSsWoRd'));
```

With `Expect`, we can make almost the same assertions as with `Assert`. So `Expect::same()`, `Expect::match()`, `Expect::count()` and so on are available. Moreover, we can chain them like:

```php
Expect::type(MyIterator::class)->andCount(5);  # item is the MyIterator object and its count is 5
```

Or, we can write own assertion callbacks.

```php
Expect::that(function ($value) {
	# return false if expectation fails
});
```


Failed assertions investigation
-------------------------------
The Tester shows where the error is when an assertion fails. When we compare complex structures, the Tester creates dumps of compared values and saves them into directory **output**. For example when imaginary test `Arrays.recursive.phpt` fails the dumps will be saved as follows:

```
demo/
└── tests/
    ├── output/
    │   ├── Arrays.recursive.actual    # actual value
    │   └── Arrays.recursive.expected  # expected value
    │
    └── Arrays.recursive.phpt          # failing test
```

We can change the name of the directory by `Tester\Dumper::$dumpDir`.



Skipping tests
==============
Some tests can run only under certain circumstances. If these circumstances aren't met, we can skip the tests. For example, required OS type:

```php
if (defined('PHP_WINDOWS_VERSION_BUILD')) {
	Tester\Environment::skip('Requires UNIX.');
}
```

Test will be stopped and marked as `s` - skipped. Later we find out how to skip the test using the `@skip` annotation.



TestCase
========
Assertions may follow one by one in simple tests. But sometimes it is useful to enclose the assertions to test class and structure them in this way. The class must be descendant of `Tester\TestCase` and we talk about it simply as about **testcase**.

```php
use Tester\Assert;

class GreetingTest extends Tester\TestCase
{
	public function testOne()
	{
		Assert::same(......);
	}

	public function testTwo()
	{
		Assert::match(......);
	}
}

# Run testing methods
(new GreetingTest)->run();
```

We can enrich a testcase by `setUp()` and `tearDown()` methods. They are called before/after every testing method:

```php
use Tester\Assert;

class NextTest extends Tester\TestCase
{
	public function setUp()
	{
		# Preparation
	}

	public function tearDown()
	{
		# Clean-up
	}

	public function testOne()
	{
		Assert::same(......);
	}

	public function testTwo()
	{
		Assert::match(......);
	}
}

# Run testing methods
(new NextTest)->run();

/*
Method calls order
------------------
setUp()
testOne()
tearDown()

setUp()
testTwo()
tearDown()
*/
```

If error occurs in a `setUp()` or `tearDown()` phase, test will fail. If error occurs in the testing method, the `tearDown()` method is called anyway, but with suppressed errors in it.



Annotations for TestCase
========================
There are a few annotations available to help us with testing methods. We write them toward the testing method.


@throws
-------
It is equal usage of `Assert::exception()` inside a testing method. But notation is more readable:

```php
/**
 * @throws RuntimeException
 */
public function testOne()
{
	...
}


/**
 * @throws LogicException  Wrong argument order
 */
public function testTwo()
{
	...
}
```


@dataProvider
-------------
This annotation suits when we want to run the testing method multiple times but with different arguments. As an argument we write method name which returns parameters for the testing method. The method must return an array or Traversable. Simple example:

```php
public function getLoopArgs()
{
	return [
		[1, 2, 3],
		[4, 5, 6],
		[7, 8, 9],
	];
}


/**
 * @dataProvider getLoopArgs
 */
public function testLoop($a, $b, $c)
{
	...
}
```

The other annotation **@dataProvider** variation accepts a path to INI file (relatively to test file) as an argument. The method is called so many times as the number of sections contained in INI file. File `loop-args.ini`:

```ini
[one]
a=1
b=2
c=3

[two]
a=4
b=5
c=6

[three]
a=7
b=8
c=9
```

and the method which uses the INI file:

```php
/**
 * @dataProvider loop-args.ini
 */
public function testLoop($a, $b, $c)
{
	...
}
```

Similarly, we can pass path to a PHP script instead of INI. It must return array or Traversable. File `loop-args.php`:

```php
 return [
	['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3],
	['a' => 4, 'b' => 5, 'c' => 6],
	['a' => 7, 'b' => 8, 'c' => 9],
 ];
```



Test file annotations
=====================
.[warning]
Following annotations are evaluated only if we run the test by the Tester, not manually as ordinary PHP script.

We write annotations at the beginning of the test file and the typing is case-insensitive. Imaginary example:

```php
/**
 * TEST: Basic database query test.
 *
 * @dataProvider files/databases.ini
 * @exitCode 56
 * @phpVersion < 5.5
 */

require __DIR__ . '/../bootstrap.php';
```


TEST:
-----
It is not an annotation actually. It only sets the test title which is printed on fail or into logs.


@skip
-----
Test is skipped. It is handy for temporary test deactivation.


@phpVersion
-----------
Test is skipped if is not run by the corresponding PHP version. We write annotation as `@phpVersion [operator] version`. We can leave out the operator, default is `>=`. Examples:

```php
/**
 * @phpVersion 5.3.3
 * @phpVersion < 5.5
 * @phpVersion != 5.4.5
 */
```


@phpExtension
-------------
Test is skipped if all mentioned PHP extension are not loaded. Multiple extensions can be written in a single annotation, or we can use the annotation multiple times.

```php
/**
 * @phpExtension pdo, pdo_pgsql, pdo_mysql
 * @phpExtension json
 */
```


@dataProvider
-------------
We write annotation as `@dataProvider file.ini`. INI file path is relative to the test file. Test runs as many times as number of sections contained in the INI file. Let's assume the INI file `databases.ini`:

```ini
[mysql]
dsn = "mysql:host=127.0.0.1"
user = root
password = ******

[postgresql]
dsn = "pgsql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test"
user = postgres
password = ******

[sqlite]
dsn = "sqlite::memory:"
```

and the file `database.phpt` in the same directory:

```php
/**
 * @dataProvider databases.ini
 */

$args = Tester\Environment::loadData();
```

The test runs three times and `$args` will contain values from sections **mysql**, **postgresql** or **sqlite**.

There is one more variation when we write annotations with a question mark as `@dataProvider? file.ini`. In this case, test is skipped if the INI file doesn't exist.

Annotation possibilities have not been mentioned all yet. We can write conditions after the INI file. Test runs for the given section only if all conditions match. Let's extend the INI file:

```ini
[mysql]
dsn = "mysql:host=127.0.0.1"
user = root
password = ******

[postgresql 8.4]
dsn = "pgsql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test"
user = postgres
password = ******

[postgresql 9.1]
dsn = "pgsql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test;port=5433"
user = postgres
password = ******

[sqlite]
dsn = "sqlite::memory:"
```

and we will use annotation with condition:

```php
/**
 * @dataProvider  databases.ini  postgresql, >=9.0
 */
```

The test runs only once for section `postgresql 9.1`. Other sections don’t match the conditions.

Similarly, we can pass path to a PHP script instead of INI. It must return array or Traversable. File `databases.php`:

```php
return [
	'postgresql 8.4' => [
		'dsn' => '...',
		'user' => '...',
	],

	'postgresql 9.1' => [
		'dsn' => '...',
		'user' => '...',
	],
];
```


@multiple
---------
We write it as `@multiple N` where **N** is an integer. Test runs exactly N-times.


@testCase
---------
Annotation has no parameters. We use it when we write a test as `Tester\TestCase` classes. In this case, the test runs as many times as the number of testing methods. Every testing method runs in a separated process. It can dramatically speed up the whole testing procedure. We recommend usage of this annotation.


@exitCode
---------
We write it as `@exitCode N` where **N** is the exit code of the test. For example if `exit(10)` is called in the test, we write annotation as `@exitCode 10`. It is considered to fail if the test ends with a different code. Exit code 0 (zero) is verified if we leave out the annotation


@httpCode
---------
Annotation is evaluated only if PHP binary is CGI. It is ignored otherwise. We write it as `@httpCode NNN` where **NNN** is expected HTTP code. HTTP code 200 is verified if we leave out the annotation. If we write `NNN` as a string evaluated as zero, for example `any`, HTTP code is not checked at all.


@outputMatch a @outputMatchFile
-------------------------------
The behavior of annotations is consistent with `Assert::match()` and `Assert::matchFile()` assertions. But pattern is found in test’s standard output. A suitable use case is when we assume the test to end by fatal error and we need to verify its output.


@phpIni
-------
It sets INI configuration values for test. For example we write it as `@phpIni precision=20` and it works in the same way as if we passed value from the command line by parameter `-d precision=20`.



Helpers
=======

DomQuery
--------
`Tester\DomQuery` class helps to test HTML or XML content. Description of all the methods is in [API documentation |https://api.nette.org/tester/Tester.DomQuery.html]. Here, we show basic usage:

```php

# HTML which we want to test
$html = $template->render();

# We create DOM structure from HTML
$dom = Tester\DomQuery::fromHtml($html);

# We can test
Assert::true($dom->has('form#registration'));
Assert::true($dom->has('input[name="username"]'));
Assert::true($dom->has('input[name="password"]'));
Assert::true($dom->has('input[type="submit"]'));
```

We use CSS selector as `DomQuery::has($selector)` parameter.


FileMock
--------
`Tester\FileMock` emulates files in memory and helps you to test a code which uses functions like `fopen()`, `file_get_contents()` or `parse_ini_file()`. For example:

```php
# Tested class
class Logger
{
	private $logFile;

	public function __construct($logFile)
	{
		$this->logFile = $logFile;
	}

	public function log($message)
	{
		file_put_contents($this->logFile, $message . "\n", FILE_APPEND);
	}
}

# New empty file
$file = Tester\FileMock::create('');

$logger = new Logger($file);
$logger->log('Login');
$logger->log('Logout');

# Created content testing
Assert::same("Login\nLogout\n", file_get_contents($file));
```


Environment::purge()
--------------------
Class `Tester\Helpers` offers method `purge()` which creates passed directory but only if doesn't exist yet. If so, it purges all its content. It is handy for temporary directory creation. For example in `tests/bootstrap.php`:

```php
@mkdir(__DIR__ . '/tmp');  # @ - directory may already exist

define('TEMP_DIR', __DIR__ . '/tmp/' . getmypid());
Tester\Helpers::purge(TEMP_DIR);
```


Environment::lock()
-------------------
Later we learn that tests run in parallel. Sometimes we need not to overlap the test running. Typically database tests need to prepare database content and they need nothing disturbs them during running time of the test. In these cases we use `Tester\Environment::lock($name, $dir)`:

```php
Tester\Environment::lock('database', __DIR__ . '/tmp');
```

The first argument is a lock name. The second one is a path to directory for saving the lock. The test which acquires the lock first runs. Other tests must wait till it is completed.


Environment::bypassFinals()
---------------------------
Classes or methods marked as `final` are hard to test. Calling the `Tester\Environment::bypassFinals()` in a test beginning causes that keywords `final` are removed during the code loading.

```php
require __DIR__ . '/bootstrap.php';

Tester\Environment::bypassFinals();

class MyClass extends NormallyFinalClass  # <-- NormallyFinalClass is not final anymore
{
	...
}
```


Environment::setup()
--------------------
- improves error dump readability (coloring included), otherwise, default PHP stack trace is printed
- enables check that assertions have been called in test, otherwise, tests without (e.g. forgotten) assertions pass too
- automatically starts code coverage collector when `--coverage` is used (described later)

Using is optional but recommended.


Environment::RUNNER
-------------------
It could be useful to know if a test is running by the Tester or manually as an ordinary PHP script.

```php
if (getenv(Tester\Environment::RUNNER)) {
	# run by Tester
} else {
	# another way
}
```


Environment::THREAD
-------------------
Tester runs tests in parallel in a given number of threads. We will find a thread number in an environmental variable when we are interested:

```php
echo "I'm running in a thread number " . getenv(Tester\Environment::THREAD).
```


Tips
====
- It is not good practice to use `exit()` and `die()` to end test with a fail message. For example `exit('Error in connection')` ends a test with exit code 0 (zero) and it means success. Always use `echo 'Error in connection'` followed by `exit(1)`.

- Choose the most accurate assertions. For example `Assert::same($a, $b)`, not `Assert::true($a === $b)`. Only in the first case we get meaningful error message. In the other case we get `false should be true` only and it says nothing about $a and $b variables contents.

- Use the `Assert::nan()` for NAN (Not a Value) testing. NAN value is very specific and assertions `Assert::same()` or `Assert::equal()` can behave unpredictably.
