Templates
*********

.[perex]
Nette uses the [Latte |latte:] template system. Latte is used because it is the most secure template system for PHP, and at the same time the most intuitive system. You don't have to learn much new, you just need to know PHP and a few Latte tags.

It is usual that the page is completed from the layout template + the action template. This is what a layout template might look like, notice the blocks `{block}` and tag `{include}`:

```latte
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>{block title}My App{/block}</title>
</head>
<body>
	<header>...</header>
	{include content}
	<footer>...</footer>
</body>
</html>
```

And this might be the action template:

```latte
{block title}Homepage{/block}

{block content}
<h1>Homepage</h1>
...
{/block}
```

It defines block `content`, which is inserted in place of `{include content}` in the layout, and also re-defines block `title`, which overwrites `{block title}` in the layout. Try to imagine the result.


Search for Templates
--------------------

The path to the templates is deduced according to simple logic. It tries to see if one of these template files exists relative to the directory where presenter class is located, where `<Presenter>` is the name of the current presenter and `<view>` is the name of the current action:

- `templates/<Presenter>/<view>.latte`
- `templates/<Presenter>.<view>.latte`

If it does not find the template, the response is [error 404 |presenters#Error 404 etc.].

You can also change the view using `$this->setView('otherView')`. Or, instead of searching, directly specify the name of the template file using `$this->template->setFile('/path/to/template.latte')`.

.[note]
You can change the paths where templates are searched by overriding the [formatTemplateFiles |api:Nette\Application\UI\Presenter::formatTemplateFiles()] method, which returns an array of possible file paths.

The layout is expected in the following files:

- `templates/<Presenter>/@<layout>.latte`
- `templates/<Presenter>.@<layout>.latte`
- `templates/@<layout>.latte` layout common to multiple presenters

`<Presenter>` is the name of the current presenter and `<layout>` is the name of the layout, which is by default `'layout'`. The name can be changed with `$this->setLayout('otherLayout')`, so that `@otherLayout.latte` files will be tried.

You can also directly specify the file name of the layout template using `$this->setLayout('/path/to/template.latte')`. Using `$this->setLayout(false)` will disable the layout searching.

.[note]
You can change the paths where templates are searched by overriding the [formatLayoutTemplateFiles |api:Nette\Application\UI\Presenter::formatLayoutTemplateFiles()] method, which returns an array of possible file paths.


Variables in the Template
-------------------------

Variables are passed to the template by writing them to `$this->template` and then they are available in the template as local variables:

```php
$this->template->article = $this->articles->getById($id);
```

In this way we can easily pass any variables to the templates. However, when developing robust applications, it is often more useful to limit ourselves. For example, by explicitly defining a list of variables that the template expects and their types. This will allow PHP to type-check, the IDE to autocomplete correctly, and static analysis to detect errors.

And how do we define such an enumeration? Simply in the form of a class and its properties. We name it similarly to presenter, but with `Template` at the end:

```php
/**
 * @property-read ArticleTemplate $template
 */
class ArticlePresenter extends Nette\Application\UI\Presenter
{
}

class ArticleTemplate extends Nette\Bridges\ApplicationLatte\Template
{
	public Model\Article $article;
	public Nette\Security\User $user;

	// and other variables
}
```

The `$this->template` object in the presenter will now be an instance of the `ArticleTemplate` class. So PHP will check the declared types when they are written. And starting with PHP 8.2 it will also warn about writing to a non-existent variable, in previous versions the same can be achieved using the [Nette\SmartObject |utils:smartobject] trait.

The `@property-read` annotation is for IDE and static analysis, it will make autocomplete work, see "PhpStorm and code completion for $this->template":https://blog.nette.org/en/phpstorm-and-code-completion-for-this-template.

You can indulge in the luxury of whispering in templates too, just install the Latte plugin in PhpStorm and specify the class name at the beginning of the template, see the article "Latte: how to type system":https://blog.nette.org/en/latte-how-to-use-type-system:

```latte
{templateType App\Presenters\ArticleTemplate}
...
```

This is also how templates work in components, just follow the naming convention and create a template class `FifteenTemplate` for the component e.g. `FifteenControl`.

If you need to create a `$template` as an instance of another class, use the `createTemplate()` method:

```php
public function renderDefault(): void
{
	$template = $this->createTemplate(SpecialTemplate::class);
	$template->foo = 123;
	// ...
	$this->sendTemplate($template);
}
```


Default Variables
-----------------

Presenters and components pass several useful variables to templates automatically:

- `$basePath` is an absolute URL path to root dir (for example `/CD-collection`)
- `$baseUrl` is an absolute URL to root dir (for example `http://localhost/CD-collection`)
- `$user` is an object [representing the user |security:authentication]
- `$presenter` is the current presenter
- `$control` is the current component or presenter
- `$flashes` list of [messages |presenters#flash-messages] sent by method `flashMessage()`

If you use a custom template class, these variables are passed if you create a property for them.


Creating Links
--------------

In template we create links to other presenters & actions as follows:

```latte
<a n:href="Product:show">detail</a>
```

Attribute `n:href` is very handy for HTML tags `<a>`. If we want to print the link elsewhere, for example in the text, we use `{link}`:

```latte
URL is: {link Homepage:default}
```

For more information, see [Creating Links].


Custom Filters, Tags, etc.
--------------------------

The Latte templating system can be extended with custom filters, functions, tags, etc. This can be done directly in the `render<View>` or `beforeRender()` method:

```php
public function beforeRender(): void
{
	// adding a filter
	$this->template->addFilter('foo', /* ... */);

	// or configure the Latte\Engine object directly
	$latte = $this->template->getLatte();
	$latte->addFilterLoader(/* ... */);
}
```

Latte version 3 offers a more advanced way by creating an [extension |latte:creating-extension] for each web project. Here is a rough example of such a class:

```php
namespace App\Templating;

final class LatteExtension extends Latte\Extension
{
	public function __construct(
		private App\Model\Facade $facade,
		private Nette\Security\User $user,
		// ...
	) {
	}

	public function getFilters(): array
	{
		return [
			'timeAgoInWords' => $this->filterTimeAgoInWords(...),
			'money' => $this->filterMoney(...),
			// ...
		];
	}

	public function getFunctions(): array
	{
		return [
			'canEditArticle' =>
				fn($article) => $this->facade->canEditArticle($article, $this->user->getId()),
			// ...
		];
	}

	// ...
}
```

We register it using [configuration#Latte]:

```neon
latte:
	extensions:
		- App\Templating\LatteExtension
```


Translating
-----------

If you are programming a multilingual application, you will probably need to output some of the text in the template in different languages. To do this, the Nette Framework defines a translation interface [api:Nette\Localization\Translator], which has a single method `translate()`. This accepts the message `$message`, which is usually a string, and any other parameters. The task is to return the translated string.
There is no default implementation in Nette, you can choose according to your needs from several ready-made solutions that can be found on [Componette |https://componette.org/search/localization]. Their documentation tells you how to configure the translator.

Templates can be set up with a translator, which [we will have passed to us|dependency-injection:passing-dependencies], using the `setTranslator()` method:

```php
protected function beforeRender(): void
{
	// ...
	$this->template->setTranslator($translator);
}
```

Alternatively, the translator can be set using the [configuration |configuration#Latte]:

```neon
latte:
	extensions:
		- Latte\Essential\TranslatorExtension
```

The translator can then be used, for example, as a filter `|translate`, with additional parameters passed to the `translate()` method (see `foo, bar`):

```latte
<a href="basket">{='Basket'|translate}</a>
<span>{$item|translate}</span>
<span>{$item|translate, foo, bar}</span>
```

Or as an underscore tag:

```latte
<a href="basket">{_'Basket'}</a>
<span>{_$item}</span>
<span>{_$item, foo, bar}</span>
```

For template section translation, there is a paired tag `{translate}` (since Latte 2.11, previously the tag `{_}` was used ):

```latte
<a href="order">{translate}Order{/translate}</a>
<a href="order">{translate foo, bar}Order{/translate}</a>
```

Translator is called by default at runtime when rendering the template. Latte version 3, however, can translate all static text during template compilation. This saves performance because each string is translated only once and the resulting translation is written to the compiled form. This creates multiple compiled versions of the template in the cache directory, one for each language. To do this, you only need to specify the language as the second parameter:

```php
protected function beforeRender(): void
{
	// ...
	$this->template->setTranslator($translator, $lang);
}
```

By static text we mean, for example, `{_'hello'}` or `{translate}hello{/translate}`. Non-static text, such as `{_$foo}`, will continue to be compiled on the fly.
