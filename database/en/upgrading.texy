Migrating from 3.1 to 3.2
=========================

The minimum required PHP version is 8.1.

The code has been carefully tuned for PHP 8.1. All new type hints for methods and properties have been added. The changes are minor:

- MySQL: zero date `0000-00-00` is returned as `null`
- MySQL: decimal without decimal places is returned as int instead of float
- The `time` type is returned as a `DateTimeImmutable` object with the date set to `0001-01-01` instead of the current date
