Creating Extensions for Nette DI
********************************

.[perex]
Generating an DI container in addition to configuration files also affect the so-called *extensions*. We activate them in the configuration file in the `extensions` section.

This is how we add the extension represented by class `BlogExtension` with name `blog`:

```neon
extensions:
	blog: BlogExtension
```

Each compiler extension inherits from [api:Nette\DI\CompilerExtension] and can implement following methods that are called during DI compilation:

1. getConfigSchema()
2. loadConfiguration()
3. beforeCompile()
4. afterCompile()


getConfigSchema() .[method]
===========================

This method is called first. It defines schema used to validate configuration parameters.

Extensions are configured in a section whose name is the same as the one under which the extension was added, eg `blog`.

```neon
# same name as my extension
blog:
	postsPerPage: 10
	comments: false
```

We will define a schema describing all configuration options, including their types, accepted values and possibly default values:

```php
use Nette\Schema\Expect;

class BlogExtension extends Nette\DI\CompilerExtension
{
	public function getConfigSchema(): Nette\Schema\Schema
	{
		return Expect::structure([
			'postsPerPage' => Expect::int(),
			'allowComments' => Expect::bool()->default(true),
		]);
	}
}
```

See the [/Schema] for documentation. Additionally, you can specify which options can be [dynamic |/application/bootstrap#Dynamic Parameters] using `dynamic()`, for example `Expect::int()->dynamic()`.

We access configuration through the `$this->config`, which is an object `stdClass`:

```php
class BlogExtension extends Nette\DI\CompilerExtension
{
	public function loadConfiguration()
	{
		$num = $this->config->postPerPage;
		if ($this->config->allowComments) {
			// ...
		}
	}
}
```


loadConfiguration() .[method]
=============================

This method is used to add services to the container. This is done by [api:Nette\DI\ContainerBuilder]:

```php
class BlogExtension extends Nette\DI\CompilerExtension
{
	public function loadConfiguration()
	{
		$builder = $this->getContainerBuilder();
		$builder->addDefinition($this->prefix('articles'))
			->setFactory(App\Model\HomepageArticles::class, ['@connection']) // or setCreator()
			->addSetup('setLogger', ['@logger']);
	}
}
```

The convention is to prefix the services added by an extension with its name so that no name conflicts arise. This is done by `prefix()`, so if the extension is called 'blog', the service will be called `blog.articles`.

If we need to rename a service, we can create an alias with its original name to maintain backward compatibility. Similarly this is what Nette does for eg `routing.router`, which is also available under the earlier name `router`.

```php
$builder->addAlias('router', 'routing.router');
```


Retrieve Services from a File
-----------------------------

We can create services using the ContainerBuilder API, but also we can add them via the familiar NEON configuration file and its `services` section. The prefix `@extension` represents the current extension.

```neon
services:
	articles:
		create: MyBlog\ArticlesModel(@connection)

	comments:
		create: MyBlog\CommentsModel(@connection, @extension.articles)

	articlesList:
		create: MyBlog\Components\ArticlesList(@extension.articles)
```

We will add services this way:

```php
class BlogExtension extends Nette\DI\CompilerExtension
{
	public function loadConfiguration()
	{
		$builder = $this->getContainerBuilder();

		// load the configuration file for the extension
		$this->compiler->loadDefinitionsFromConfig(
			$this->loadFromFile(__DIR__ . '/blog.neon')['services'],
		);
	}
}
```


beforeCompile() .[method]
=========================

The method is called when the container contains all the services added by individual extensions in `loadConfiguration` methods as well as user configuration files. At this phase of assembling, we can then modify service definitions or add links between them. You can use the `findByTag()` method to search for services by tags, or `findByType()` method to search by class or interface.

```php
class BlogExtension extends Nette\DI\CompilerExtension
{
	public function beforeCompile()
	{
		$builder = $this->getContainerBuilder();

		foreach ($builder->findByTag('logaware') as $name) {
			$builder->getDefinition($name)->addSetup('setLogger');
		}
	}
}
```


afterCompile() .[method]
========================

At this phase, the container class is already generated as a [ClassType |/php-generator#classes] object, it contains all the methods that the service creates, and is ready for caching as PHP file. We can still edit the resulting class code at this point.

```php
class BlogExtension extends Nette\DI\CompilerExtension
{
	public function afterCompile(Nette\PhpGenerator\ClassType $class)
	{
		$method = $class->getMethod('__construct');
		// ...
	}
}
```


$initialization .[wiki-method]
==============================

The Configurator calls the initialization code after [container creation |/application/bootstrap#index.php], which is created by writing to an object `$this->initialization` using [method addBody() |/php-generator#Method and Function Body Generator].

We will show an example of how to start a session or start services that have the `run` tag using initialization code:

```php
class BlogExtension extends Nette\DI\CompilerExtension
{
	public function loadConfiguration()
	{
		// automatic session startup
		if ($this->config->session->autoStart) {
			$this->initialization->addBody('$this->getService("session")->start()');
		}

		// services with tag 'run' must be created after the container is instantiated
		$builder = $this->getContainerBuilder();
		foreach ($builder->findByTag('run') as $name => $foo) {
			$this->initialization->addBody('$this->getService(?);', [$name]);
		}
	}
}
```
