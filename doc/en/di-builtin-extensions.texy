DI: Built-in Container Extensions
*********************************

Package `nette/di` contains a few built-in extension to DI container.

ExtensionsExtension
===================

Using this extension we can add a more extensions defined in NEON configuration files.

```neon
extensions:
	dibi: Dibi\Bridges\Nette\DibiExtension22
```

That's the way how we add `Dibi\Bridges\Nette\DibiExtension22` extension named `dibi`, so settings will be in `dibi` section.

```neon
dibi:
	host: localhost
```

We can pass arguments into constructor for extension class.

```neon
extensions:
	application: Nette\Bridges\ApplicationDI\ApplicationExtension(%debugMode%, %appDir%, %tempDir%/cache)
```


InjectExtension
===============

This extension allows us to use option `inject: true`, which enables passing dependencies via variables with [@inject |di-usage#toc-inject-annotations] annotation and [inject* | di-usage#toc-passing-by-an-inject-method] methods.

```neon
services:
	blog.articles:
		factory: App\Model\Articles
		inject: true
```

```php
namespace App\Model;

use Nette\Database\Connection;

class Articles
{
	/** @var Connection @inject */
	public $connection;
}
```

By default is `inject` attribute enabled only for presenters.


DecoratorExtension
==================

Using this extensions we can add tags or add `setup` (eg call methods) to all services of given class or implementing given interface.

```neon
decorator:
	# key is class or interface name
	App\Repository\AbstractRepository:
		setup:
			- setConnection
		inject: true

	App\Component\BaseControl:
		setup:
			- setTranslator(@mytranslator)
		tags: [view]
```


SearchExtension
===============

Search extension walks through given directories and registers found classes as services automatically.

```neon
search:
	# section name can be ommited if you want to search in only one directory
	section:
		in: %appDir%/Forms
		# file masks, *.php is default
		files: ['*.php', '*.php5']
		# array of masks, class name must match at least one
		classes:
			- App\*Form
		# only classes extending one of specified clasess will be registered
		extends: Nette\Application\UI\Form
		# only classes implementing at least one of specified interfaces will be registered
		implements: []
		# rules for excluding classes from auto registration
		exclude:
			classes: []
			extends: []
			implements: []
		# classes will be registered with specified tags
		tags: []
```


PhpExtension
============

You can set PHP extensions using this extension. For an overview of all directives, look at [php.net |http://php.net/manual/en/ini.list.php].

```neon
php:
	date.timezone: Europe/Prague
```


ConstantsExtension
==================

We can define PHP contants by this extension.

```neon
constants:
	FOOBAR: 'baz'
```

The `FOOBAR` constant will available in our application after startup.
