URL Routing
***********

/--div .[perex]
Routing is a two-way conversion between URL and presenter action. *Two-way* means that we can both determine what presenter URL links to, but also vice versa: generate URL for given action. This article contains:

- how to define routes and create links
- a few notes about SEO redirection
- how to debug defined routes
- how to create your own router

What is a Routing?
==================

Routing is a **two-way conversion** between **URL** and an **application request**.

- `Nette\Http\IRequest` (includes URL) -> `Nette\Application\Request`
- `Nette\Application\Request` -> absolute URL


Thanks to bidirectional routing you don't have to hardcode URLs into templates, but you simply link to [presenters' actions|presenters#toc-handling-presenter-actions] and framework generates the URLs for you:

/--html
{* creates URL to presenter 'Product' and action 'detail' *}
<a n:href="Product:detail $productId">product detail</a>
\--

Learn more about [creating links |presenters#link-creation].

Routing is a **separate application layer**. This allow you to very efficiently manipulate with the URL structure without the need to modify the application itself. It's simple to change routes anytime, while keeping the original addresses preserved and automatically redirect to the new variants. So hey, who's got that? :-)


SimpleRouter
============

Desired URL format is set by a *router*, which is usually defined in [bootstrap.php |presenters#index-php-bootstrap-php] file. The most plain implementation of router is [SimpleRouter | api:Nette\Application\Routers\SimpleRouter]. It can be used when there's no need for a specific URL format, or when `mod_rewrite` (or alternatives) is not available.

Addresses look like this:

/--
http://example.com/index.php?presenter=Product&action=detail&id=123
\--

The first argument of `SimpleRouter` constructor is a default presenter action, ie. action to be executed if we open for example `http://example.com/` without additional parameters. The declaration itself in a `bootstrap.php` file might look as follows: (`$container` is a [system DI container |configuring])

/--php
use Nette\Application\Routers\SimpleRouter;

// defaults to presenter Homepage and action default
$container->addService('router', new SimpleRouter('Homepage:default'));
\--


Route: for prettier URLs
========================

Human-friendly URLs (also more cool & prettier) are easier to remember and do help SEO((search engine optimalization)). Nette Framework keeps current trends in mind and fully meets developers' desires.

.[note]
All requests must be handled by `index.php` file. This can be accomplished e.g. by using Apache module `mod_rewrite` (see [how to enable mod_rewrite |troubleshooting#how-to-enable-mod-rewrite]) or Nginx's try_files (available by default).

Class [Route | api:Nette\Application\Routers\Route] can create addresses in pretty much any format one can though of. Let's start with a simple example generating a pretty URL for action `Product:default` with `id = 123`:

/--
http://example.com/product/detail/123
\--

The following snippet creates a `Route` object, passing path mask as the first argument and specifying default action in the second argument.

/--php
// action defaults to presenter Homepage and action default
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>[/<id>]', 'Homepage:default');
\--

This route is usable by all presenters and actions. Accepts paths such as `/article/edit/10` or `/catalog/list`, because the `id` part is wrapped in square brackets, which marks it as [optional | #optional sequences].

Because other parameters (`presenter` and `action`) do have default values (`Homepage` and `default`), they are optional too. If their value is the same as the default one, they are skipped while URL is generated. Link to `Product:default` generates only `http://example.com/product` and link to `Homepage:default` generates only `http://example.com/`.


Path Mask
---------

The simplest path mask consists only of a **static URL** and a target presenter action.

/--php
$route = new Route('products', 'Products:default');
\--

Most real masks however contain some **parameters**. Parameters are enclosed in angle brackets (e.g. `<year>`) and are passed to target presenter.

/--php
$route = new Route('history/<year>', 'History:view');
\--

Mask can also contain traditional GET arguments (query after a question mark). Neither validation expressions nor more complex structures are supported in this part of path mask, but you can set what key belongs to which variable:

/-- php
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action> ? id=<productId> & cat=<categoryId>', ...);
\--

.[note]
The parameters before a question mark are called *path parameters* and the parameters after a question mark are called *query parameters*.


/--comment
TERMINOLOGY ISSUE:
I've decided to use terminilogy by @Panda (http://edu.lynt.cz/course/download/?fileId=10). @DG uses "absolute path" for what I call here "relative to server document root" and "absolute URL" for what I call "absolute path". Any idea how to resolve this?
\--

Mask can not only describe path relative to application document root (web root), but can as well contain path relative to server document root (starts with a single slash) or absolute path with domain (starts with a double slash).

/--php
// relative to application document root (www directory)
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>', ...);

// relative to server document root
$route = new Route('/<presenter>/<action>', ...);

// absolute path including hostname
$route = new Route('//<subdomain>.example.com/<presenter>/<action>', ...);
\--

Absolute path mask may utilize the following variables:
- `%tld%` = top level domain, e.g. `com` or `org`
- `%domain%` = second level domain, e.g. `example.com`
- `%basePath%`

/--php
$route = new Route('//www.%domain%/%basePath%/<presenter>/<action>', ...);
\--



Route Collection
----------------

Because we usually define more than one route, we wrap them into a [RouteList | api:Nette\Application\Routers\RouteList]. The following code snippet shows a [bootstrap.php |presenters#index-php-bootstrap-php] example (`$container` is a [system DI container |configuring]):

/--php
use Nette\Application\Routers\RouteList,
	Nette\Application\Routers\Route;

$router = new RouteList();
$router[] = new Route('rss.xml', 'Feed:rss');
$router[] = new Route('article/<id>', 'Article:view');
$router[] = new Route('<presenter>/<action>[/<id>]', 'Homepage:default');

$container->addService('router', $router);
\--

.[note]
Unlike other frameworks, Nette does not require routes to be named.

It's importnat in which order routes are defined as they are tried from top to bottom. The rule of thumb here is that routes are declared from the **most specific at the top** to the **most vague at the bottom**. Keep in mind that huge amount of routes can negatively effect application speed, mostly when generating links. It's worth to keep routes as simple as possible.

.[note]
If no route is found, a [BadRequestException | api:Nette\Application\BadRequestException] is thrown, which is shown as 404 Not Found to the user.


Default Values
--------------

Each parameter may have defined a default value in the mask:

/--php
$route = new Route('<presenter=Homepage>/<action=default>/<id=>');
\--

Or utilizing an array:

/--php
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>/<id>', array(
	'presenter' => 'Homepage',
	'action' => 'default',
	'id' => NULL,
));

// equals to the following complex notation
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>/<id>', array(
	'presenter' => array(
		Route::VALUE => 'Homepage',
	),
	'action' => array(
		Route::VALUE => 'default',
	),
	'id' => array(
		Route::VALUE => NULL,
	),
));
\--

Default values for `<presenter>` and `<action>` can also be written as a string in the second constructor parameter.

/--php
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>/<id=>', 'Homepage:default');
\--



Validation Expressions
----------------------

Each parameter may have defined a **regular expression** which it needs to match. This regular expression is checked both when matching and generating URL. For example let's set `id` to be only numerical, using `\d+` regexp:

/--php
// regexp can be defined directly in the path mask after parameter name
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>[/<id \d+>]', 'Homepage:default');

// equals to the following complex notation
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>[/<id>]', array(
	'presenter' => 'Homepage',
	'action' => 'default',
	'id' => array(
		Route::PATTERN => '\d+',
	),
));
\--


.[note]
Default validation expression for path parameters is `[^/]+`, meaning all characters but a slash. If a parameter is supposed to match a slash as well, we can set the regular expression to `.+`.

.[note]
Regular expressions are *case-insensitive* by default. You need to set `Route::CASE_SENSITIVE` flag to make them *case-sensitive*.


Optional Sequences
------------------

Square brackets denote optional parts of mask. Any part of mask may be set as optional, including those containing parameters:

/--php
$route = new Route('[<lang [a-z]{2}>/]<name>', 'Article:view');

// Accepted URLs:      Parameters:
//   /en/download        action => view, lang => en, name => download
//   /download           action => view, lang => NULL, name => download
\--

Obviously, if a parameter is inside an optional sequence, it's optional too and defaults to `NULL`. Sequence should define it's surroundings, in this case a slash which must follow a parameter, if set.
The technique may be used for example for optional language subdomains:

/--php
$route = new Route('//[<lang=en>.]%domain%/<presenter>/<action>', ...);
\--

Sequences may be freely nested and combined:

/--php
$route = new Route(
	'[<lang [a-z]{2}>[-<sublang>]/]<name>[/page-<page=0>]',
	'Homepage:default'
);

// Accepted URLs:
//   /cs/hello
//   /en-us/hello
//   /hello
//   /hello/page-12
\--


URL generator tries to keep the URL as short as possible (while unique), so what can be omitted is not used. That's why `index[.html]`  route generates `/index`. This behavior can be inverted by writing an exclamation mark after the leftmost square bracket that denotes the respective optional sequence:

/--php
// accepts both /hello and /hello.html, generates /hello
$route = new Route('<name>[.html]');

// accepts both /hello and /hello.html, generates /hello.html
$route = new Route('<name>[!.html]');
\--


Optional parameters (ie. parameters having default value) without square brackets do behave as if wrapped like this:

/--php
$route = new Route('<presenter=Homepage>/<action=default>/<id=>');

// equals to:
$route = new Route('[<presenter=Homepage>/[<action=default>/[<id>]]]');
\--

If we would like to change how the rightmost slashes are generated, that is instead of `/homepage/` get a `/homepage`, we can adjust the route:

/--php
$route = new Route('[<presenter=Homepage>[/<action=default>[/<id>]]]');
\--



Foo Parameters
--------------

Foo parameters are similar to optional sequences, but they are used to match a regular expression. The following route matches `/index`, `/index.html`, `/index.htm` and `/index.php`:

/--php
$route = new Route('index<? \.html?|\.php>', 'Homepage:default');
\--

It's also possible to explicitly define a string which will be used for URL generation (similar to setting default value for real parameters). The string must be placed directly after the question mark. The following route is similar to the previous one, but generates `/index.html` instead of `/index`, because the string `.html` is set as a "default value".

/--php
$route = new Route('index<?.html \.html?|\.php>', 'Homepage:default');
\--



Flags
-----

`Route` default behavior can be altered by several flags which can be passed as the third constructor parameter.

**ONE_WAY flag** - One way routes are usually used to preserve old URLs functionality, when an application is rewritten. Flag `Route::ONE_WAY` marks routes, which are not used for URL generation.

/--php
// old URL /product-info?id=123, new URL /product/123
$router[] = new Route('product-info', 'Product:detail', Route::ONE_WAY);
$router[] = new Route('product/<id>', 'Product:detail');
\--

**SECURED flag** - Routes can be forced to use HTTPS by `Route::SECURED` flag. That's useful for authentication pages, as well as administration etc. HTTPS must be supported by your hosting/server.

/--php
$route = new Route('admin/<presenter>/<action>', 'Admin:default',
	Route::SECURED);
\--


/--comment
	If you want to make route work with both HTTP and HTTPS you can write something like

	/--php
	// source https://github.com/nette/nette/pull/1196
	$secured = $request->isSecured() ? Route::SECURED : 0;
	$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>', 'Homepage:default', $secured);
	\--
\--

**CASE_SENSITIVE flag** - Routes are *case-insensitive* by default. Use `Route::CASE_SENSITIVE` to make a route *case-sensitive*.

/--php
// accepts all '/loRem', '/LOREM' and '/lorem'
$route = new Route('<slug lorem>', 'Page:view');

// accepts only '/lorem'
$route = new Route('<slug lorem>', 'Page:view', Route::CASE_SENSITIVE);
\--

Flags can be freely combined using bitwise OR operator (`|`) and it is possible to set some flags as default for all routes using `Route::$defaultFlags` property.

/--php
// makes all routes case sensitive
Route::$defaultFlags |= Route::CASE_SENSITIVE;
\--



Transformation and Translation
------------------------------

It's a good practice to write source code in English, but what if you need your application to run in a different environment? Simple routes such as:

/--php
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>/<id>', array(
	'presenter' => 'Homepage',
	'action' => 'default',
	'id' => NULL,
));
\--

will generate English URLs, such as `/product/detail/123`, `/cart` or `/catalog/view`. If we would like to translate those URLs, we can use a *dictionary* defined under `Route::FILTER_TABLE` key. We'd extend the route so:

/--php
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>/<id>', array(
	'presenter' => array(
		Route::VALUE => 'Homepage', // default value
		Route::FILTER_TABLE => array(
			// translated string in URL => presenter
			'produkt' => 'Product',
			'einkaufswagen' => 'Cart',
			'katalog' => 'Catalog',
		),
	),
	'action' => array(
		Route::VALUE => 'default',
		Route::FILTER_TABLE => array(
			'sehen' => 'view',
		),
	),
	'id' => NULL,
));
\--

.[tip]
Multiple keys may have the same value. That's how aliases are created. The last value is the canonical one (used for link generation).

Dictionaries may be applied to any path parameter. If a translation is not found, the original (non-translated) value is used. The route by default accepts both translated (e.g. `/einkaufswagen`) and original (e.g. `/cart`) URLs. If you would like to accept only translated URLs, you need to add `Route::FILTER_STRICT => TRUE` to the route definition.


Besides setting dictionaries as arrays, it's possible to set **input and output filters**. Input and output filter are callbacks defined under `Route::FILTER_IN` and `Route::FILTER_OUT` keys respectively.

/--php
$route = new Route('<presenter=Homepage>/<action=default>', array(
	'action' => array(
		Route::FILTER_IN => function($action) {
			return strrev($action);
		},
		Route::FILTER_OUT => function($action) {
			return strrev($action);
		},
	),
));
\--

The **input filter** accepts value from URL and should return a value which will be passed to a presenter. The **output filter** accepts value from presenter and should return a value which will be used in URL. If any of those filters is unable to filter the value (usually because it is invalid), it should return `NULL`.

/--comment
	Because input and output filters are more powerful concept than dictionary filtering, the previous example with `Route::FILTER_TABLE` can be rewritten as follows:

	/--php
	$filterTable = array(
		'produkt' => 'Product',
		'einkaufswagen' => 'Cart',
		'katalog' => 'Catalog',
	);

	$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>/<id>', array(
		'presenter' => array(
			Route::VALUE => 'Homepage',
			Route::FILTER_IN => function($presenter) use ($filterTable) {
				if (isset($filterTable[$presenter])) {
					return $filterTable[$presenter];
				} else {
					return $presenter;
				}
			},
			Route::FILTER_OUT => function($presenter) use ($filterTable) {
				return array_search($presenter, $filterTable) ?: $presenter;
			},
		),
		'action' => array(
			Route::VALUE => 'default',
			Route::FILTER_IN => function($action) {
				if ($action === 'sehen') $action = 'view';
				return $action;
			},
			Route::FILTER_OUT => function($action) {
				if ($action === 'view') $action = 'sehen';
				return $action;
			},
		),
		'id' => NULL,
	));
	\--
\--



Styles
------

.[caution]
We recommend not to use custom styles due to their static nature.

Default configuration for each parameter is taken from its style. Styles for path parameters are named after them (e.g. `id`), styles for query parameters are prefixed with a question mark (e.g. `?id`). If such style does not exist, the default one is used. The one for path parameters is called `#` and the one for query parameters is called `?#`. Parameters can also specify explicitly its style in the path mask after a hash sign (e.g. `<id#customStyle>`).

To define a new style call `Route::addStyle($name, $parentStyle)` method. The parent style parameter is used to define a style which the new style will be based on. To configure existing style call `Route::setStyleProperty($style, $key, $value)`.


For example let's define that all `<id>` path parameters in all routes must be numeric.

/--php
// define a new style, based on # = default for path parameters
Route::addStyle('id', '#');

// change validation expression
Route::setStyleProperty('id', Route::PATTERN, '\d+');

// in the following route the <id> must be numeric
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>[/<id>]', ...);
\--

.[note]
Styles must be defined before the route which is using them is created.

You can also define general styles (not for specific parameter), they just need to start with a hash sign (`#`).

/--php
Route::addStyle('#numeric', '#');
Route::setStyleProperty('#numeric', Route::PATTERN, '\d+');

// in the following route the <id> will use the #numeric style
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>[/<id#numeric>]', ...);
\--

.[tip]
Have a quick look at the [default styles | api:Nette\Application\Routers\Route::$styles].



Routing Debugger
================

We should keep it no secret that routes may seem to be magical for a while. But you will always appreciate value of Routing Debugger. It's a [Debugger bar | debugging] panel, which gives you a list of all parameters a router got and a list of all defined routers. It's turn on automatically, as long as the application runs in debug mode. It also shows on which presenter and action you are currently on.

SEO and canonization
====================

Framework increases SEO (search engine optimalization) as it prevents multiple URLs to link to different content (without a proper redirect). If more than one addresses link to same target (`/index` and `/index.html`), framework choses the first (makes it canonical) and redirect other to it with HTTP code 301. Thanks to that your page won't have duplicities on search engines and their rank won't be split.

This whole process is the so called canonication. Default (canonical) url is the one router generaets, that is first route in collection without `ONE_WAY` flag.

Canonization is done by [Presenter | api:Nette\Application\UI\Presenter] and it's switched on by default. You may disable it by setting `$presenter->autoCanonicalize = FALSE`.

.[note]
Ajax and POST requests are not redirected as user would suffer either a data loss, or it would yell no additional SEO value.


Modularity
==========

If we want to add separate modules into our application that have their own routes, for example a discussion forum, we may define routes elsewhere, possibly in `createRoutes()` method:

/--php
class Forum
{
	static function createRoutes($router, $prefix)
	{
		$router[] = new Route($prefix . 'index.php', 'Forum:Homepage:default');
		$router[] = new Route($prefix . 'admin.php', 'Forum:Admin:default');
		...
	}
}
\--

"Routing-in" the forum into existing application can be as easy as calling this method: (`bootstrap.php`)

/--php
$router = new RouteList;
// our routes
...

// adding forum module
Forum::createRoutes($router, '//forum.example.com/');

$container->addService('router', $router);
\--


Custom router
=============

If these offered routes do not fit your needs, you may create your own router and add it to your *router collection*. Router is nothing more but an implementation of [IRouter | api:Nette\Application\IRouter] with it's two methods:

/-- php
class MyRouter implements Nette\Application\IRouter
{
	function match(Nette\Http\IRequest $httpRequest){ }

	function constructUrl(Nette\Application\Request $appRequest, Nette\Http\Url $refUrl) { }
}
\--

Method `match` does process current [$httpRequest | api:Nette\Http\Request] (which offers more than just the URL) into internal [Nette\Application\Request | api:Nette\Application\Request] which contains presenter name and it's parameters. If original request could not be processed, return NULL.

Method `constructUrl` generates absolute URL from internal request, possibly utilizing information from `$refUrl` argument.

Possibilities of custom routers are unlimited, for example it's possible to implement a router based on database records.
