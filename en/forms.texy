Forms

<div class=perex>

Nette Forms has revolutionized the creation of web forms. All you had to do was write a few clear lines of code and you had a form, including rendering, JavaScript, and server validation, plus industry-leading security. Let's see how

- create friendly forms
- validate sent data
- draw elements exactly as needed

</div>


With Nette Forms, you can diminish routine tasks like writing validation (on both server and client-side), and minimizing the likelihood of errors and security issues.

You can use the forms either as a part of the Nette Application (ie in presenters) or standalone. Because the use is slightly different in both cases, we have prepared separated instructions for you:

<div class="columns wiki-buttons">
<div class="column">"Forms in presenters .[wiki-button]":form-presenter </div>
<div class="column">"Forms standalone .[wiki-button]":form-standalone </div>
</div>
