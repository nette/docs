Configuring Database
********************

.[perex]
Overview of configuration options for the Nette Database.

If you are not using the whole framework, but only this library, read [how to load the configuration|bootstrap:].


Single Connection
-----------------

Configure a single database connection:

```neon
database:
	# DSN, only mandatory key
	dsn: "sqlite:%appDir%/Model/demo.db"
	user: ...
	password: ...
```

Creates the services `Nette\Database\Connection` and `Nette\Database\Explorer`, which are usually passed by [autowiring |dependency-injection:autowiring] or by referring to [their name |#DI Services].

Other settings:

```neon
database:
	# shows database panel in Tracy Bar?
	debugger: ...     # (bool) defaults to true

	# shows query EXPLAIN in Tracy Bar?
	explain: ...      # (bool) defaults to true

	# to enable autowiring for this connection?
	autowired: ...    # (bool) defaults to true for first connection

	# table conventions: discovered, static, or class name
	conventions: discovered  # (string) defaults to 'discovered'

	options:
		# to connect to the database only when needed?
		lazy: ...     # (bool) defaults to false

		# PHP database driver class
		driverClass:  # (string)

		# MySQL only: sets sql_mode
		sqlmode:      # (string)

		# MySQL only: sets SET NAMES
		charset:      # (string) defaults to 'utf8mb4'

		# MySQL only: converts TINYINT(1) to bool
		convertBoolean: # (bool) defaults to false

		# returns date columns as immutable objects (since version 3.2.1)
		newDateTime:  # (bool) defaults to false

		# only Oracle and SQLite: date format
		formatDateTime: # (string) defaults to 'U'
```

The `options` key can contain other options that can be found in the [PDO driver documentation |https://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.drivers.php], such as:

```neon
database:
	options:
		PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_COMPRESS: true
```


Multiple Connections
--------------------

In the configuration we can define more database connections by dividing them into named sections:

```neon
database:
	main:
		dsn: 'mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test'
		user: root
		password: password

	another:
		dsn: 'sqlite::memory:'
```

Autowiring is enabled only for services from the first section. This can be changed using `autowired: false` or `autowired: true`.


DI Services
-----------

These services are added to the DI container, where `###` represents the connection name:

| Name | Type | Description
|----------------------------------------------------------
| `database.###.connection` | [api:Nette\Database\Connection] | database connection
| `database.###.explorer` | [api:Nette\Database\Explorer] | [Database Explorer |explorer]


If we define only one connection, the service names will be `database.default.connection` and `database.default.explorer`. If we define multiple connections as in the example above, the names will correspond to the sections, i.e. `database.main.connection`, `database.main.explorer` and then `database.another.connection` and `database.another.explorer`.

We pass the non-authenticated services explicitly by referring to their name:

```neon
services:
	- UserFacade(@database.another.connection)
```
