/--div .[perex]
Components are foundation of reusable code. They make your work easier and allows to profit from community work. Components are wonderful.
We'll explain

- how to write components
- what are signals
- how to send flash messages
- how to use AJAX
\--

Component is a renderable object. It can be form, menu, poll etc. Within one page there can be as much components as you wish. At http://addons.nette.org/cs you can find open-source components which were put there by volunteers from the Nette Framework community.

You can find an example of a component and it's use in page in the [example Fifteen | https://github.com/nette/examples/tree/master/Fifteen].

Component is a descendant of class [api:Nette\Application\UI\Control]:

/--php
use Nette\Application\UI\Control;

class PollControl extends Control
{
}
\--

.[note]
When talking about components, we usually mean descendants of class [Control | api:Nette\Application\UI\Control]. Components are basically controls in framework's terminology.


Templates
=========

Component has factory for its [template | templating]. It creates template, passes several variables (shown below) and registers [default helpers]. Rendering is our job and it is done in method `render()`. This is where we choose the file from which will be the template loaded. `render()` method is also the right place to register variables used in the template. Template can be put inside the same folder as component and with the same file name.

/--php
public function render()
{
	$template = $this->template;
	$template->setFile(dirname(__FILE__) . '/PollControl.latte');
	// insert some parameters to the template
	$template->param = 'some value';
	// render it
	$template->render();
}
\--


Links
=====

Method `link()` is made for [linking to signals| #signal (subrequest)]. Links are rendered using macro `{link}` in the template.

Use in component:

/--php
$url = $this->link('click!', $x, $y);
\--

Use in template:

/--html
<a n:href="click! $x, $y"> ... </a>
\--


Flash messages
==============

Component has its own storage of flash messages independent on presenter. These messages inform about result of operations which are **followed by redirection**.

Sending is done by method [flashMessage |api:Nette\Application\UI\Control::flashMessage()]. The first parameter is message's text and second (optional) parameter is its type (error, warning, info, etc.). Method `flashMessage()` returns an instance of flash message to whom you can pass informations.

Example:

/--php
public function deleteFormSubmitted(Form $form)
{
    ... delete record using model ...

    // pass flash message
    $this->flashMessage('Item was deleted.');

    $this->redirect(...); // and redirect
}
\--

Template receives this messages automatically in variable `$flashes`. This variable contains an array of objects (`stdClass`) which contains properties `message`, `type` and can contain extra information mentioned above.

Example:
/--php
{foreach $flashes as $flash}
<div class="flash {$flash->type}">{$flash->message}</div>
{/foreach}
\--

If `flashMessage()` is saved and redirection occurs, the same parameter `$flashes` will be present in the template. Messages then stay *alive* for the next three seconds - to prevent their loss in case that page loading was not successful and user refreshed the request. If someone refreshes the page (F5) twice in a row the flash message persists, if s/he clicks elsewhere it disappears.


Signal (subrequest)
===================

Signal (subrequest) is a communication with server under the level of normal view. Signals are actions without change of view. Only presenter can change view therefore components work only with signals. `$component->link()` links to signal, `$presenter->link()` usually links to view (unless an exclamation mark is used - `$presenter->link('signal!')`). But component can call `$component->presenter->link('view')`.

Signal causes reload of the page like the original request (with the exception of AJAX) and invokes method `signalRecieved($signal)` whose default implementation in class `PresenterComponent` tries to call method composed of words `handle{Signal}`.
Next processing relies on given object. Objects which are descendants of `PresenterComponent` (i.e. `Control` and `Presenter`) tries to call `handle{Signal}` with relevant parameters.

In other words: the definition of method `handle{Signal}` is taken and all parameters which where received in the request are matched with method's parameters. It means that parameter `id` from URL is matched to method's parameter `$id`, `something` to `$something` and so on. And if method doesn't exists, method `signalReceived` throws [an exception |api:Nette\Application\UI\BadSignalException].

Example signal handler:

/--php
public function handleClick($x, $y)
{
    if (!$this->isClickable($x, $y)) {
        throw new Nette\Application\UI\BadSignalException('Action not allowed.');
    }

    // ... processing of signal ...
}
\--

.[note]
Signal can be received by any component, presenter of object which implements interface `ISignalReceiver` if it's connected to component tree.

Main receivers of signals are `Presenters` and visual components extending `Control` (these are **automatically invalidate** which is important for AJAX). Signal is a sign for object that it has to do something - poll counts in a vote from user, box with news has to unfold, form was sent and has to process data and so on.

.[note]
Signal is always called on current presenter and view therefore it is impossible to point it elsewhere.

URL for signal is created using the method [PresenterComponent::link() |api:Nette\Application\UI\PresenterComponent::link()]. As parameter `$destination` we pass string `{signal}!` and as `$args` an array of arguments which we want to pass to signal handler. Signal parameters are attached to URL of current presenter/view. **Parameter `?do` in URL determines the signal called.**

Its format is `{signal}` or `{signalReceiver}-{signal}`. `{signalReceiver}` is name of component in presenter. This is why hyphen (inaccurately dash) can't be presenter in name of components - it is used to divide name of component and signal, but it's possible to compose several components.

Method [isSignalReceiver()|api:Nette\Application\UI\Presenter::isSignalReceiver()] verifies whether component (first argument) is receiver of signal (second argument). Second argument can be omitted - then it finds out if component is receiver of any signal. If the second parameter is `TRUE` it verifies whether component or its descendants are receiver of signal.

In any phase preceding `handle{Signal}` can be signal performed manually by calling method [processSignal()|api:Nette\Application\UI\Presenter::processSignal()] which takes responsibility for signal execution. Takes receiver component (if not set it is presenter itself) and sends it the signal.

Example:

/--php
if ($this->isSignalReceiver($this, 'paging') || $this->isSignalReceiver($this, 'sorting')) {
    $this->processSignal();
}
\--

The signal is executed prematurely and it won't be called again.


Subrequest vs. request
----------------------

Difference between signal and request:

* subrequest keeps all components
* request keeps only persistent components


Invalidation and snippets
=========================

During processing of signal can occur changes which require re-rendering of component. Three methods takes care about this: [invalidateControl()|api:Nette\Application\UI\Control::invalidateControl()], [validateControl()|api:Nette\Application\UI\Control::validateControl()] and [isControlInvalid()|api:Nette\Application\UI\Control::isControlInvalid()]. They are basic elements of using AJAX with Nette.

Nette also offers even higher granularity of validity, then only on components level, with use of [snippets | ajax].

Snippets can be invalidated one by one (any component can have as many snippets as needed). If whole component is invalidated than each of its snippets is invalidated too. Component is considered invalid if any of its children (components) is invalid.

More information can be found on [the page about AJAX | ajax].


Persistent parameters
=====================

It is often needed to keep some parameter in component, for the whole time of working with component. It can be for example number of page in pagination. This parameter should be marked as persistent using [annotation | php-language-enhancements#annotations] `@persistent`.

/--php
class PollControl extends Control
{
    /** @persistent */
    public $page = 1;

    ...
}
\--

This parameter will be automatically passed in every link as a `GET` parameter until user leaves the page with this component.

.[caution]
Never trust blindly to persistent parameters because they can be easily faked (by overwriting the URL). Verify, for example, if the page number is within correct interval.


Advanced use of components
==========================

Components are mostly renderable. But also unrendereable components exist. Some components can have descendants some not. Nette Framework introduces several classes and interfaces for all these types of components.

Object inheritance allows us to have a hierarchic structure of classes like in real world. We can create new classes by extending. These extended classes are descendants of the original class and inherit its parameters and methods. Extended class can add its own parameters and methods to the inherited ones.

Knowledge class hierarchy is required for proper understanding how things work.

/--
Nette\Object
   |
   +- Nette\ComponentModel\Component  { IComponent }
      |
      +- Nette\ComponentModel\Container  { IContainer }
         |
         +- Nette\Application\UI\PresenterComponent  { ISignalReceiver, IStatePersistent }
            |
            +- Nette\Application\UI\Control  { IPartiallyRenderable }
               |
               +- Nette\Application\UI\Presenter  { IPresenter }
\--


Nette\ComponentModel\IComponent .{toc: IComponent}
-------------------------------

Interface [api:Nette\ComponentModel\IComponent] has to be implemented by every component. It requires method `getName()` which is returning it's name and `getParent()` returning it's parent. Both name and parent can be set using method `setParent()` - first argument is parent and the second one is name.


Nette\ComponentModel\Component .{toc: Component}
------------------------------

[api:Nette\ComponentModel\Component] is a standard implementation of `IComponent`. It is common ancestor of all components including form elements. It has several methods for traversing:

[lookup($type)|api:Nette\ComponentModel\Component::lookup()] looks up object of given class or interface up in the hierarchy. For example `$component->lookup('Nette\Application\UI\Presenter')` returns presenter if the components is bound to it (even deep in the hierarchy).

[lookupPath($type)|api:Nette\ComponentModel\Component::lookupPath()] returns path - a string made by concatenating names of all components on the way between current and component of `$type`. For example `$component->lookupPath('Nette\Application\UI\Presenter')` returns unique identifier of component toward presenter.


Nette\ComponentModel\IContainer .{toc: IContainer}
-------------------------------

Parent components implement not just `IComponent` but also [api:Nette\ComponentModel\IContainer]. Interface which contains methods for adding, removing, getting and iteration over components. Such components can create hierarchy - presenters can contain forms and these forms can contain form inputs. Whole tree hierarchy of components is created by branches of `IContainer` objects and `IComponent` leafs.


Nette\ComponentModel\Container .{toc: Container}
------------------------------

[api:Nette\ComponentModel\Container] is a standard implementation of `IContainer` interface. It is an ancestor of for example form or classes `Control` and `Presenter`.

It offers methods for correct adding, getting and removing objects and of course iteration over its contents. Attempt to call undefined child causes invoking of factory [createComponent($name)|api:Nette\ComponentModel\Container::createComponent()]. Method `createComponent($name)` invokes method `createComponent<component name>` in current component and it passes name of the component as a parameter. Created component is then passed to current component as its child. We call theese component factories, they can be implemented in classes inherited from `Container`.


Nette\Application\UI\PresenterComponent .{toc: PresenterComponent}
---------------------------------------

Class [api:Nette\Application\UI\PresenterComponent] is an ancestor of all components used in presenter. Components in presenter are object which are kept by presenter during its [life cycle | presenters#toc-life-cycle-of-presenter].

They have ability to influence each other, save their states into URL and respond to user commands (signals) and does not have to be renderable.


Nette\Application\UI\Control .{toc: Control}
----------------------------

[Control | api:Nette\Application\UI\Control] is a renderable component. It is a reusable part of web application which is this whole chapter about. When talking about components this is the class we usually have on mind. It remembers which it's part should be rendered in [AJAX request |ajax#toc-invalidation], which [we've already talked about|#invalidation and snippets].

`Control` isn't representing visual sector of webpage, but it's logical part. It is possible to render it repeatedly, conditionally and every time with different template.


Component tree
--------------

The same component can be rendered more than once on page if given different names (this can be done dynamically). Parent can be presenter, component or other object implementing `IContainer`.

Hierarchy can look like following:

/--
Nette\Application\UI\Presenter { root of tree of components is always a presenter }
  |
  --Nette\Application\UI\Control { implements IContainer => can be parent }
     |
     --Nette\ComponentModel\Component
     |
     --Nette\ComponentModel\Component { does not implement IContainer => cannot be parent }
     |
     --Nette\Application\UI\Control
        |
        --Nette\ComponentModel\Component
\--


Delayed composition
-------------------

Component model in Nette offers very dynamical tree workflow (components can be removed, added, moved). It would be a mistake to rely on knowing parent (in constructor) when the component is created. In most cases, parent is not not known when the component is created.

/--php
$control = new NewsControl;
// ...
$parent->addComponent($control, 'shortNews');
\--


Monitoring changes
------------------

How to find out when was component added to presenter's tree? Watching the change of parent is not enough because a parent of parent might have been added to presenter. Method [monitor($type)|api:Nette\ComponentModel\Component::monitor()] is here to help. Every component can monitor any number of classes and interfaces. Adding or removing is reported by invoking method `attached($obj)` (`detached($obj)` respectivelly), where `$obj` is the object of monitored class.

An example: Class `UploadControl`, representing form element for uploading files in `Nette\Forms`, has to set form's attribute `enctype` to value `multipart/form-data`. But in the time of the creation of the object it does not have to be attached to any form. When to modify the form? The solution is simple - we create a request for monitoring in the constructor:

/--php
class UploadControl extends Nette\Forms\Controls\BaseControl
{
    public function __construct($label)
    {
        $this->monitor('Nette\Forms\Form');
        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
\--

and method `attached` is called when the form is available:

/--php
protected function attached($form)
{
    parent::attached($form);

    if ($form instanceof Nette\Forms\Form) {
        $form->getElementPrototype()->enctype = 'multipart/form-data';
    }
}
\--

Monitoring and lookup of components or paths using `lookup` is **very precisely optimized for maximal performance**.


Iterating over children
-----------------------

There is a method [getComponents($deep = FALSE, $type = NULL)|api:Nette\ComponentModel\Container::getComponents()] for that. First parameter determines if the components should be looked up in depth (recursively). With `TRUE`, it not only iterates all it's children, but also all chilren of it's children, etc. Second parameter servers as an optional filter by class or interface.

For example, this is the way how validation of forms is "internally"((this is done by framework itself, you don't have to call it explicitly)) performed:

/--php
$valid = TRUE;
foreach ($form->getComponents(TRUE, 'Nette\Forms\IControl') as $control) {
    if (!$control->getRules()->validate()) {
        $valid = FALSE;
        break;
    }
}
