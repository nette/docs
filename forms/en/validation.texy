Forms Validation
****************


Required Controls
=================

Controls are marked as required with the method `setRequired()`, whose argument is the text of the [error message|#Error Messages] that will be displayed if the user does not fill it. If no argument is given, the default error message is used.

```php
$form->addText('name', 'Name:')
	->setRequired('Please fill your name.');
```


Rules
=====

We add validation rules to controls with the `addRule()` method. The first parameter is the rule, the second is the [error message|#Error Messages], and the third is the validation rule argument.

```php
$form->addPassword('password', 'Password:')
	->addRule($form::MIN_LENGTH, 'Password must be at least %d characters', 8);
```

Nette comes with a number of built-in rules whose names are constants of the `Nette\Forms\Form` class:

We can use the following rules for all controls:

| constant | description | arguments
|-------
| `REQUIRED` | alias of `setRequired()`  | -
| `FILLED` | alias of `setRequired()`  | -
| `BLANK` | must not be filled  | -
| `EQUAL` | value is equal to parameter  | `mixed`
| `NOT_EQUAL` | value is not be equal to parameter  | `mixed`
| `IS_IN` | value is equal to some element in the array | `array`
| `IS_NOT_IN` | value does not equal any element in the array | `array`
| `VALID` | input passes validation (for [#conditions])  | -

For controls `addText()`, `addPassword()`, `addTextArea()`, `addEmail()`, `addInteger()` the following rules can also be used:

| `MIN_LENGTH` | minimal string length | `int`
| `MAX_LENGTH` | maximal string length | `int`
| `LENGTH` | length in range or exact length | pair `[int, int]` or `int`
| `EMAIL` | valid email address | -
| `URL` | valid URL | -
| `PATTERN` | matches regular pattern | `string`
| `PATTERN_ICASE` | like `PATTERN`, but case-insensitive; since nette/forms v2.4.9 | `string`
| `INTEGER` | integer | -
| `NUMERIC` | alias of `INTEGER` | -
| `FLOAT` | integer or floating point number | -
| `MIN` | minimum of the integer value | `int\|float`
| `MAX` | maximum of the integer value | `int\|float`
| `RANGE` | value in the range | pair `[int\|float, int\|float]`

The `INTEGER`, `NUMERIC` a `FLOAT` rules automatically convert the value to integer (or float respectively). Furthermore, the `URL` rule also accepts an address without a schema (eg `nette.org`) and completes the schema (`http://nette.org`).
The expressions in `PATTERN` and `PATTERN_ICASE` must be valid for the whole value, ie as if it were wrapped in the characters `^` and `$`.

For controls `addUpload()`, `addMultiUpload()` the following rules can also be used:

| `MAX_FILE_SIZE` | maximal file size | `int`
| `MIME_TYPE` | MIME type, accepts wildcards (`'video/*'`) | `string\|string[]`
| `IMAGE` | uploaded file is JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP | -
| `PATTERN` | file name matches regular expression; since nette/forms v2.4.9 | `string`
| `PATTERN_ICASE` | like `PATTERN`, but case-insensitive; since nette/forms v2.4.9 | `string`

The `MIME_TYPE` and `IMAGE` require PHP extension `fileinfo`. Whether a file or image is of the required type is detected by its signature. The integrity of the entire file is not checked. You can find out if an image is not corrupted for example by trying to [load it|http:request#toImage].

For controls `addMultiUpload()`, `addCheckboxList()`, `addMultiSelect()` the following rules can also be used to limit the number of selected items, respectively uploaded files:

| `MIN_LENGTH` | minimal count | `int`
| `MAX_LENGTH` | maximal count | `int`
| `LENGTH` | count in range or exact count | pair `[int, int]` or `int`

All rules can be negated with `~` (a tilde), i.e. `addRule(~$form::NUMBER, ...)` passes validation if field is not filled, which is deprecated since Nette 3, so you need to use another corresponding rule (for example opposite of `FILLED` is `BLANK`).


Error Messages
--------------

All predefined rules except `PATTERN` and `PATTERN_ICASE` have a default error message, so they it be omitted. However, by passing and formulating all customized messages, you will make the form more user-friendly.

You can change the default messages in [forms:configuration], by modifying the texts in the `Nette\Forms\Validator::$messages` array or by using translator.

The following wildcards can be used in the text of error messages:

| `%d`     | gradually replaces the rules after the arguments
| `%n$d`   | replaces with the nth rule argument
| `%label` | replaces with field label (without colon)
| `%name`  | replaces with field name (eg `name`)
| `%value` | replaces with value entered by the user

```php
$form->addText('name', 'Name:')
	->setRequired('Please fill in %label');

$form->addInteger('id', 'ID:')
	->addRule($form::RANGE, 'at least %d and no more than %d', [5, 10]);

$form->addInteger('id', 'ID:')
	->addRule($form::RANGE, 'no more than %2$d and at least %1$d', [5, 10]);
```


Conditions
==========

Besides validation rules, conditions can be set. They are set much like rules, yet we use `addRule()` instead of `addCondition()` and of course, we leave it without an error message (the condition just asks):

```php
$form->addPassword('password', 'Password:')
	// if password is not longer than 8 characters ...
	->addCondition($form::MAX_LENGTH, 8)
		// ... then it must contain a number
		->addRule($form::PATTERN, 'Must contain number', '.*[0-9].*');
```

Condition can be linked to a different element than the current one using `addConditionOn()`. The first parameter is a reference to the field. In the following case, the email will only be required if the checkbox is checked (ie. its value is `true`):

```php
$form->addCheckbox('newsletters', 'send me newsletters');

$form->addEmail('email', 'Email:')
	// if checkbox is checked ...
	->addConditionOn($form['newsletters'], $form::EQUAL, true)
		// ... require email
		->setRequired('Fill your email address');
```

Conditions can be grouped into complex structures with `elseCondition()` and `endCondition()` methods.

```php
$form->addText(/* ... */)
	->addCondition(/* ... */) // if the first condition is met
		->addConditionOn(/* ... */) // and the second condition on another element too
			->addRule(/* ... */) // require this rule
		->elseCondition() // if the second condition is not met
			->addRule(/* ... */) // require these rules
			->addRule(/* ... */)
		->endCondition() // we return to the first condition
		->addRule(/* ... */);
```

All conditions can be negated with `~` (a tilde), i.e. `addCondition(~$form::NUMBER, ...)` passes validation if field is not filled, which is deprecated since Nette 3, so you need to use else-condition.

In Nette, it is very easy to react to the fulfillment or not of a condition on the JavaScript side using the `toggle()` method, see [#Dynamic JavaScript].


References Between Controls
===========================

The rule or condition argument can be a reference to another element. For example, you can dynamically validate that the `text` has as many characters as the value of the `length` field is:

```php
$form->addInteger('length');
$form->addText('text')
	->addRule($form::LENGTH, null, $form['length']);
```


Custom Rules and Conditions
===========================

Sometimes we get into a situation where the built-in validation rules in Nette are not enough and we need to validate the data from the user in our own way. In Nette this is very easy!

You can pass any callback as the first parameter to the `addRule()` or `addCondition()` methods. The callback accepts the element itself as the first parameter and returns a boolean value indicating whether the validation was successful. When adding a rule using `addRule()`, additional arguments can be passed, and these are then passed as the second parameter.

The custom set of validators can thus be created as a class with static methods:

```php
class MyValidators
{
	// tests whether the value is divisible by the argument
	public static function validateDivisibility(BaseControl $input, $arg)
	{
		return $input->getValue() % $arg === 0;
	}

	public static function validateEmailDomain(BaseControl $input, $domain)
	{
		// additional validators
	}
}
```

The usage is then very simple:

```php
$form->addInteger('num')
	->addRule(
		[MyValidators::class, 'validateDivisibility'],
		'The value must be a multiple of %d',
		8
	);
```

Custom validation rules can also be added to JavaScript. The only requirement is that the rule must be a static method. Its name for the JavaScript validator is created by concatenating the class name without backslashes `\`, the underscore `_`, and the method name. For example, write `App\MyValidators::validateDivisibility` as `AppMyValidators_validateDivisibility` and add it to the `Nette.validators` object:

```js
Nette.validators['AppMyValidators_validateDivisibility'] = (elem, args, val) => {
	return val % args === 0;
};
```


Event onValidate
================

After the form is submitted, validation is performed by checking the individual rules added by `addRule()` and then calling [event|nette:glossary#Events] `onValidate`. Its handler can be used for additional validation, typically to verify the correct combination of values in multiple form elements.

If an error is detected, it is passed to the form using the `addError()` method. This can be called either on a specific element or directly on the form.

```php
protected function createComponentSignInForm()
{
	$form = new Form;
	// ...
	$form->onValidate[] = [$this, 'validateSignInForm'];
	return $form;
}

public function validateSignInForm(Form $form, \stdClass $data)
{
	if ($data->foo > 1 && $data->bar > 5) {
		$form->addError('This combination is not possible.');
	}
}
```


Processing Errors
=================

In many cases, we discover an error when we are processing a valid form, e.g. when we write a new entry to the database and encounter a duplicate key. In this case, we pass the error back to the form using the `addError()` method. This can be called either on a specific item or directly on the form:

```php
try {
	$data = $form->getValues();
	$this->user->login($data->username, $data->password);
	$this->redirect('Homepage:');

} catch (Nette\Security\AuthenticationException $e) {
	if ($e->getCode() === Nette\Security\IAuthenticator::INVALID_CREDENTIAL) {
		$form->addError('Invalid password.');
	}
}
```

If possible, we recommend adding the error directly to the form element, as it will appear next to it when using the default renderer.

```php
$form['date']->addError('Sorry, this date is already taken.');
```

You can call `addError()` repeatedly to pass multiple error messages to a form or element. You get them with `getErrors()`.

Note that `$form->getErrors()` returns a summary of all error messages, even those passed directly to individual elements, not just directly to the form. Error messages passed only to the form are retrieved via `$form->getOwnErrors()`.


Modifying Input Values
======================

Using the `addFilter()` method, we can modify the value entered by the user. In this example, we will tolerate and remove spaces in the zip code:

```php
$form->addText('zip', 'Postcode:')
	->addFilter(function ($value) {
		return str_replace(' ', '', $value); // remove spaces from the postcode
	})
	->addRule($form::PATTERN, 'The postal code is not five digits', '\d{5}');
```

The filter is included between the validation rules and conditions and therefore depends on the order of the methods, ie the filter and the rule are called in the same order as is the order of the `addFilter()` and `addRule()` methods.


JavaScript Validation
=====================

The language of validation rules and conditions is powerful. Even though all constructions work both server-side and client-side, in JavaScript. Rules are transferred in HTML attributes `data-nette-rules` as JSON.
The validation itself is handled by another script, which hooks all form's `submit` events, iterates over all inputs and runs respective validations.

This script is `netteForms.js`, which is available from several possible sources:

You can embed the script directly into the HTML page from the CDN:

```latte
<script src="https://nette.github.io/resources/js/2/netteForms.min.js"></script>
```

Or copy locally to the public folder of the project (e.g. from `vendor/nette/forms/src/assets/netteForms.min.js`):

```latte
<script src="/path/to/netteForms.min.js"></script>
```

Or install via [npm|https://www.npmjs.com/package/nette-forms]:

```bash
npm install nette-forms
```

And then load and run:

```js
import netteForms from 'nette-forms';
netteForms.initOnLoad();
```

Alternatively, you can load it directly from the folder `vendor`:

```js
import netteForms from '../path/to/vendor/nette/forms/src/assets/netteForms.js';
netteForms.initOnLoad();
```


Dynamic JavaScript
==================

Do you only want to show the address fields only if the user chooses to send the goods by post? No problem. The key is a pair of methods `addCondition()` & `toggle()`:

```php
$form->addCheckbox('send_it')
	->addCondition($form::EQUAL, true)
		->toggle('#address-container');
```

This code says that when the condition is met, that is, when the checkbox is checked, the HTML element `#address-container` will be visible. And vice versa. So, we place the form elements with the recipient's address in a container with that ID, and when the checkbox is clicked, they are hidden or shown. This is handled by the `netteForms.js` script.

Any selector can be passed as an argument to the `toggle()` method. For historical reasons, an alphanumeric string with no other special characters is treated as an element ID, the same as if it were preceded by the `#` character. The second optional parameter allows us to reverse the behavior, i.e. if we used `toggle('#address-container', false)`, the element would be displayed only if the checkbox was unchecked.

The default JavaScript implementation changes the `hidden` property for elements. However, we can easily change the behavior, for example by adding an animation. Just override the `Nette.toggle` method in JavaScript with a custom solution:

```js
Nette.toggle = (selector, visible, srcElement, event) => {
	document.querySelectorAll(selector).forEach((el) => {
		// hide or show 'el' according to the value of 'visible'
	});
};
```


Disabling Validation
====================

In certain cases, you need to disable validation. If a submit button isn't supposed to run validation after submitting (for example *Cancel* or *Preview* button), you can disable the validation by calling `$submit->setValidationScope([])`. You can also validate the form partially by specifying items to be validated.

```php
$form->addText('name')
	->setRequired();

$details = $form->addContainer('details');
$details->addInteger('age')
	->setRequired('age');
$details->addInteger('age2')
	->setRequired('age2');

$form->addSubmit('send1'); // Validates the whole form
$form->addSubmit('send2')
	->setValidationScope([]); // Validates nothing
$form->addSubmit('send3')
	->setValidationScope([$form['name']]); // Validates only 'name' field
$form->addSubmit('send4')
	->setValidationScope([$form['details']['age']]); // Validates only 'age' field
$form->addSubmit('send5')
	->setValidationScope([$form['details']]); // Validates 'details' container
```

[#Event onValidate] on the form is always invoked and is not affected by the `setValidationScope`. `onValidate` event on the container is invoked only when this container is specified for partial validation.
