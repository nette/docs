DI: Services Configuration
**************************

/--div .[perex]
Dependency Injection (DI) container is easily configured using NEON files. We'll talk about:

- how to use parameters
- how to add and setup services
- how to include multiple configuration files
\--

Configuration is usually written in NEON format. Have fun trying out the syntax at https://ne-on.org.


Parameters
==========

You can define parameters which can then be used as part of service definitions. This can help to separate out values that you will want to change more regularly.

Use the `parameters` section of a config file to set parameters:

/--neon
parameters:
	dsn: 'mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test'
	user: root
	password: secret
\--

You can refer to `foo` parameter via `%foo%` elsewhere in any config file. They can also be used inside strings like `'%wwwDir%/images'`.

Parameters do not need to be flat strings, they can also contain array values:

/--neon
parameters:
	mailer:
		host: smtp.example.com
		secure: ssl
		user: franta@gmail.com
	languages: [cs, en, de]
\--

You can refer to single key as `%mailer.user%`.

.[note]
If you use a string that starts with `@` or has `%` anywhere in it, you need to escape it by adding another `@` or `%`.


Services
========

The configuration file is place where we add definitions of our own services in section `services`. For example, this is definition of service named `database` which is `PDO` instance:

/--neon
services:
	# in single line
	database: PDO(%dsn%, %user%, %password%)

	# or multi-lines
	database:
		factory: PDO(%dsn%, %user%, %password%)

	# with parameter names (the order does not matter)
	database:
		factory: PDO(dsn: %dsn%, username: %user%)

	# or more multi-lines :-)
	database:
		factory: PDO
		arguments: [%dsn%, %user%, %password%]
\--

It generates factory method in DI container:

/--php
function createServiceDatabase()
{
	$service = new PDO('mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test', 'root', 'secret');
	return $service;
}
\--

In addition to creating a class instance, you can also call the method:

/--neon
services:
	database: Database::create(root, password)
\--

Result:

/--php
function createServiceDatabase()
{
	$service = Database::create('root', 'secret');
	return $service;
}
\--

In this case, the `Database::create()` method must have a defined return type either by using an annotation `@return` or a PHP 7 type hint.

We obtain the service from the DI container using the `getService()`:

/--php
$database = $container->getService('database');
\--


Setup
-----

We can call service methods or set properties and static properties:

/--neon
services:
	database:
		factory: PDO(%dsn%, %user%, %password%)
		setup:
			- setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION)
			- $mode = 123

	myService:
		factory: MyService
		setup:
			- MyService::$foo = 2
\--

Result:

/--php
public function createServiceDatabase()
{
	$service = new PDO('mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test', 'root', 'secret');
	$service->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
	$service->mode = 123;
	return $service;
}

public function createServiceMyService()
{
	$service = new MyService;
	MyService::$foo = 2;
	return $service;
}
\--

In addition to strings and numbers, the method parameters can also be arrays, created objects or method calls:

/--neon
services:
	analyser: My\Analyser(
		FilesystemIterator(%appDir%)
		[dryrun: yes, verbose: no]
		DateTime::createFromFormat('Y-m-d')
	)
\--

Result:

/--php
public function createServiceAnalyser()
{
	return new My\Analyser(
		new FilesystemIterator('...'),
		['dryrun' => true, 'verbose' => false],
		DateTime::createFromFormat('Y-m-d')
	);
}
\--


Anonymous Services
------------------

Named services are particularly useful when we want to refer to them from other parts of the configuration file. If the service is no longer referenced by name, it does not need to be named. For anonymous services, use the following syntax:

/--neon
services:
	- PDO('sqlite::memory:)

	-
		factory: Model\ArticleRepository
		setup:
			- setCacheStorage
\--

We get the service from the DI container using the `getByType()`:

/--php
$database = $container->getByType(PDO::class);
$repository = $container->getByType(Model\ArticleRepository::class);
\--


Service Referencing
===================

We refer to the service using at-sign and the name of the service, ie. `@database`:

/--neon
services:
	database: PDO(%dsn%, %user%, %password%)
	articles:
		factory: Model\ArticleRepository(@database)
		setup:
			- setCacheStorage(@cache.storage)   # cache.storage is a system service
\--

Result:

/--php
public function createServiceArticles()
{
	$service = new Model\ArticleRepository($this->getService('database'));
	$service->setCacheStorage($this->getService('cache.storage'));
	return $service;
}
\--

Even anonymous services can be referred to via `@`, instead of their name we use their type (class or interface). However, this does not usually have to be done thanks to [#autowiring].

/--neon
services:
	articles:
		factory: Model\ArticleRepository(@Nette\Database\Connection)  # or @\PDO
\--


Advanced syntax
===============

The NEON format gives us extraordinary powerful syntax expression, with which you can write almost everything.

We can call referenced service's methods, but for simplicity we write `::` instead of `->`:

/--neon
services:
	routerFactory: App\Router\Factory
	router: @routerFactory::create()
\--

Result:

/--php
public function createServiceRouterFactory()
{
	return new App\Router\Factory;
}

public function createServiceRouter()
{
	return $this->getService('routerFactory')->create();
}
\--

Calling a method can be concatenated:

/--neon
services:
	foo: FooFactory::build()::get()
\--

Generates:

/--php
public function createServiceFoo()
{
	return FooFactory::build()->get();
}
\--

Method calls can also be used in parameters. In addition to the methods, we can also call global functions, before its name we put `::`:

/--neon
services:
	routerFactory: App\Router\Factory( Foo::bar() )   # static method calling
	setup:
		- setIp( @http.request::getRemoteAddress() )  # http.request is system service
		- setMode( ::getenv(NETTE_MODE) )             # global function getenv
\--

Generates:

/--php
public function createServiceRouterFactory()
{
	$service = new App\Router\Factory( Foo::bar() );
	$service->setIp( $this->getService('http.request')->getRemoteAddress() );
	$service->setMode( getenv('NETTE_MODE') );
	return $service;
}
\--

The form `ClassName([parameters, ...])`, which we usually use in the `factory` entry and which means creating an object, actually corresponds to the PHP syntax, except that we omit the `new` operator. We can also use this syntax anywhere else, for example as a parameter:

/--neon
services:
	articles:
		factory: Model\ArticleRepository( PDO(%dsn%, %user%, %password%) )
		setup:
			- setCacheStorage( Nette\Caching\Storages\DevNullStorage() )
\--

Generates:

/--php
public function createServiceArticles()
{
	$service = new Model\ArticleRepository( new PDO('mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test', 'root', 'secret') );
	$service->setCacheStorage( new Nette\Caching\Storages\DevNullStorage );
	return $service;
}
\--

Even we can call the created object's methods:

/--neon
services:
	router: App\Router\Factory()::create()
	# don't confuse with App\Router\Factory::create()
\--

Generates:

/--php
public function createServiceRouter()
{
	return (new App\Router\Factory())->create();
}
\--



Autowiring
==========

Autowiring is a great feature that can automatically pass services to the constructor and other methods, so we do not need to write them at all. It saves you a lot of time.

The example of `articles` can be simplified as follows:

/--neon
services:
	articles:
		factory: Model\ArticleRepository
		setup:
			- setCacheStorage
\--

Autowiring is driven by typehints, so `ArticleRepository` class must be defined as follows:

/--php
namespace Model;

class ArticleRepository
{
	public function __construct(\PDO $db)
	{}

	public function setCacheStorage(\Nette\Caching\IStorage $storage)
	{}
}
\--


Limited Autowiring
------------------

To use autowiring, there must be just one service for each type in the container. If there were more, autowiring would not know which one to pass and throw away an exception:

/--neon
services:
	mainDatabase: PDO(%dsn%, %user%, %password%)
	tempDatabase: PDO('sqlite::memory:)
	articles: Model\ArticleRepository  # THROWS EXCEPTION
\--

The solution would be to bypass autowiring and explicitly name the service (ie `articles: Model\ArticleRepository(@mainDatabase)`). Or we can make one of our services not autowired. Autowiring will then work and will automatically pass the second service:

/--neon
services:
	mainDatabase: PDO(%dsn%, %user%, %password%)

	tempDatabase:
		factory: PDO('sqlite::memory:)
		autowired: no                    # removes tempDatabase from autowiring

	articles: Model\ArticleRepository    # therefore passes mainDatabase to constructor
\--

Autowiring can also be restricted to specific classes or interfaces. We will show you on the example:

/--php
interface FooInterface
{}

class BarClass implements FooInterface
{}

class FooDependent
{
	function __construct(FooInterface $obj)
	{}
}

class BarDependent
{
	function __construct(BarClass $obj)
	{}
}
\--

The first example without limitation of autowiring:

/--neon
services:
	bar: BarClass
	fooDep: FooDependent  # autowiring passes the service bar to the constructor
	barDep: BarDependent  # autowiring passes the service bar to the constructor
\--

In both cases, autowiring passes the `bar` service to the constructor because it satisfies `BarClass` and `FooInterface`. But now we limit it only to the interface:

/--neon
services:
	bar:
		factory: BarClass
		autowired: FooInterface

	fooDep: FooDependent  # autowiring passes the service bar to the constructor
	barDep: BarDependent  # THROWS EXCEPTION
\--

Autowiring at `barDep` throws the `Nette\DI\ServiceCreationException` exception because there is no service that would pass to the constructor. The `bar` service is resolved under `FooInterface` instead of `BarClass`. And vice versa, if we use `autowired: BarClass`, the service `fooDep` threw the exception.

The `autowired` key can include several classes and interfaces as array:

/--neon
services:
	bar:
		factory: BarClass
		autowired: [BarClass, FooInterface]
\--

Similarly, this will work in the case of inheritance, as shown in another example:

/--php
class ParentClass
{}

class ChildClass extends ParentClass
{}

class ParentDependent
{
	function __construct(ParentClass $obj)
	{}
}

class ChildDependent
{
	function __construct(ChildClass $obj)
	{}
}
\--

We'll add the services into the configuration file with the `child` being limited to autowiring only for `ChildClass` (and descendants):

/--neon
services:
	child:
		factory: ChildClass
		autowired: ChildClass   # you can use 'self'

	parentDep: ParentDependent  # THROWS EXCEPTION, the 'child' service can not be used
	childDep: ChildDependent    # autowiring passes the service 'child' to the constructor
\--

In this case, `autowired: ChildClass` could be written as `autowired: self` as the `self` means service type.


Preferred Autowiring
--------------------

In autowiring, we can also prefer certain services for certain types. We will use the above classes for the demonstration.

If we registered them all as services, autowiring would fail:

/--neon
services:
	parent: ParentClass
	child: ChildClass
	parentDep: ParentDependent  # autowiring passes the service 'child' to the constructor
	childDep: ChildDependent    # THROWS EXCEPTION
\--

The `parentDep` service throws the exception `Multiple services of type ParentClass found: parent, child`, because both `parent` and `child` fit into its constructor and autowiring can not make a clear decision on which one to choose.

For service `child`, we can limit its autowing to `ChildClass`, so it will not be passed to where `ParentClass` is expected, which we have already shown above. But now we also add service `parent`:

/--neon
services:
	parent: ParentClass
	child:
		factory: ChildClass
		autowired: ChildClass

	parentDep: ParentDependent  # autowiring passes the service 'parent' to the constructor
	childDep: ChildDependent    # autowiring passes the service 'child' to the constructor
\--

In the case of `parentDep`, the `parent` is passed to the constructor because it is now the only satisfactory object due to the restrictions defined in `child`. By limiting it, however, it has also become a *preferred service* for this type. Therefore, `childDep` does not throw the exception that there are two satisfactory services (ie `child` and `parent`) that can be passed to the constructor but use the preferred service, `child`.


Multiple Configuration Files
============================

Use `includes` section to add more configuration files.

/--neon
includes:
	- parameters.php
	- services.neon
	- presenters.neon
\--

If items with the same keys appear in configuration files, they will be overwritten or merged in the case of arrays. The later included file has higher priority. The file with the `includes` section has higher priority than included files.

<table class=table>
<tr>
	<th width=33%>config1.neon</th>
	<th width=33%>config2.neon</th>
	<th>result</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>
/--neon
items:
	- 1
	- 2
\--
	</td>
	<td>
/--neon
items:
	- 3
\--
	</td>
	<td>
/--neon
items:
	- 1
	- 2
	- 3
\--
	</td>
</tr>
</table>

To prevent merging of a certain array use exclamation mark right after the name of the array:

<table class=table>
<tr>
	<th width=33%>config1.neon</th>
	<th width=33%>config2.neon</th>
	<th>result</th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>
/--neon
items:
	- 1
	- 2
\--
	</td>
	<td>
/--neon
items!:
	- 3
\--
	</td>
	<td>
/--neon
items:
	- 3
\--
	</td>
</tr>
</table>
