After the first two chapters you will have your own working blog and you'll be ready to publish your awesome posts, although the features will be pretty much limited after completing these two chapters. To make things nicer for your users, you should also read the following chapters and keep improving your application.

You can find the [complete application on GitHub |https://github.com/nette/tutorial-quickstart/tree/v2.1]. The blog in this repository is a little bit more complex compared to what this tutorial covers, so be ready to learn.

This QuickStart was written for Nette Framework 2.1.0 and PHP 5.3 or newer. Check out your version.
