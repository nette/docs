Bootstrap
*********

<div class=perex>

Bootstrap is boot code that initializes the environment, creates a Dependency Injection (DI) container, and starts the application. We will discuss:

- how to configure your application using NEON files
- how to handle production and development modes
- how to create the DI container

</div>


Applications, whether web-based or command-line scripts, begin by some form of environment initialization. In ancient times, it could be a file named eg  `include.inc.php` that was in charge of this, and was included in the initial file.
In modern Nette applications, it has been replaced by the `Bootstrap` class, which as part of the application can be found in the `app/Bootstrap.php`. It might look for example like this:

```php
use Nette\Configurator;

class Bootstrap
{
	public static function boot(): Configurator
	{
		$configurator = new Configurator;
		//$configurator->setDebugMode('secret@23.75.345.200');
		$configurator->enableTracy(__DIR__ . '/../log');
		$configurator->setTempDirectory(__DIR__ . '/../temp');
		$configurator->createRobotLoader()
			->addDirectory(__DIR__)
			->register();
		$configurator->addConfig(__DIR__ . '/config/common.neon');
		return $configurator;
	}
}
```

index.php
=========

In the case of web applications, the initial file is `index.php`, which is located in the public directory `www/`. It lets the `Bootstrap` class to initialize the environment and return the `$configurator` which creates DI container. Then it obtains the `Application` service, that runs the web application:

```php
// initialize the environment + get Nette\Configurator object
$configurator = App\Bootstrap::boot();
// create a DI container
$container = $configurator->createContainer();
// DI container creates a Nette\Application\Application object
$application = $container->getByType(Nette\Application\Application::class);
// start Nette application
$application->run();
```

As you can see, the [api:Nette\Configurator] class, which we will now introduce in more detail, helps with setting up the environment and creating a Dependency Injection (DI) container.


Development vs Production Mode
==============================

If the application is running on *localhost*, the developement mode is automatically activated. Otherwise it runs in production mode. Therefore, there is usually no need to configure or switch manually between development and production modes.

If you want to enable developement mode in other cases, for example, for programmers accessing from a specific IP address, you can use `setDebugMode()`:

```php
$configurator->setDebugMode('23.75.345.200'); // one or more IP addresses
```

We definitely recommend combining an IP address with a cookie. We will store a secret token into the `nette-debug' cookie, e.g. `secret1234`, and the development mode will be activated for programmers with this combination of IP and cookie.

```php
$configurator->setDebugMode('secret1234@23.75.345.200');
```

We can also turn off developer mode completely, even for localhost:

```php
$configurator->setDebugMode(false);
```


Debugging Tool Tracy
====================

For easy debugging, we will turn on the great tool [Tracy |tracy:]. In developer mode it visualizes errors and in production mode it logs errors to the specified directory:

```php
$configurator->enableTracy(__DIR__ . '/../log');
```


Caching
=======

Nette uses the cache for DI container, RobotLoader, templates, etc. Therefore it is necessary to set the path to the directory where the cache will be stored:

```php
$configurator->setTempDirectory(__DIR__ . '/../temp');
```

On Linux or macOS, set the [write permissions |troubleshooting#Setting directory permissions] for directories `log/` and `temp/`.


RobotLoader
===========

Usually, we will want to automatically load the classes using [RobotLoader |robotloader], so we have to start it up and let it load classes from the directory where `Bootstrap.php` is located (i.e. `__DIR__`) and all its subdirectories:

```php
$configurator->createRobotLoader()
	->addDirectory(__DIR__)
	->register();
```

An alternative way is to only use [Composer |composer] PSR-4 autoloading.


Timezone
========

Configurator allows you to specify a timezone for your application.

```php
$configurator->setTimeZone('Europe/Prague');
```


DI Container Configuration
==========================

Part of the boot process is the creation of a DI container, ie a factory for objects, which is the heart of the whole application. It is actually a PHP class generated by Nette and stored in a cache directory. The factory produces key application objects and configuration files instruct it how to create and configure them, and thus we influence the behavior of the whole application.

Configuration files are usually written in the [NEON format]. You can read  [what can be configured here|configuring].

.[tip]
In the development mode, the container is automatically updated each time you change the code or configuration files. In production mode, it is generated only once and file changes are not checked to maximize performance.

Configuration files are loaded using `addConfig()`:

```php
$configurator->addConfig(__DIR__ . '/config/common.neon');
```

The method `addConfig()` can be called multiple times to add multiple files.

```php
$configurator->addConfig(__DIR__ . '/config/common.neon');
$configurator->addConfig(__DIR__ . '/config/local.neon');
if (PHP_SAPI === 'cli') {
	$configurator->addConfig(__DIR__ . '/config/cli.php');
}
```

The name `cli.php` is not a typo, the configuration can also be written in a PHP file, which returns it as an array.

Alternatively, we can use the [`includes` section|configuring#including files] to load more configuration files.

If items with the same keys appear within configuration files, they will be [overwritten or merged |di-services#Multiple configuration files] in the case of arrays. Later included file has a higher priority than the previous one. The file in which the `includes` section is listed has a higher priority than the files included in it.


Static Parameters
-----------------

Parameters used in configuration files can be defined [in the section `parameters`|configuring#parameters] and also passed (or overwritten) by the `addParameters()` method. It is important that different parameter values cause the generation of additional DI containers, i.e. additional classes.

```php
$configurator->addParameters([
	'projectId' => 23,
]);
```

In configuration files, we can write usual notation `%projectId%` to access the parameter named `projectId`. By default, the Configurator populates the following parameters: `appDir`, `wwwDir`, `tempDir`, `vendorDir`, `debugMode` and `consoleMode`.


Dynamic Parameters
------------------

We can also add dynamic parameters to the container, their different values, unlike static parameters, will not cause the generation of new DI containers.

```php
$configurator->addDynamicParameters([
	'remoteIp' => $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'],
]);
```

Environment variables could be easily made available using dynamic parameters. We can access them via `%env.variable%` in configuration files.

```php
$configurator->addDynamicParameters([
	'env' => $_ENV,
]);
```


Imported Services
-----------------

We're going deeper now. Although the purpose of a DI container is to create objects, exceptionally there may be a need to insert an existing object into the container. We do this by defining the service with the `imported: true` attribute.

```neon
services:
	myservice:
		type: App\Model\MyCustomService
		imported: true
```

Create a new instance and insert it in bootstrap:

```php
$configurator->addServices([
	'myservice' => new App\Model\MyCustomService('foobar'),
]);
```


Different Environments
======================

Feel free to customize the `Bootstrap` class to suit your needs. You can add parameters to the `boot()` method to differentiate web projects, or add other methods, such as `bootForTests()`, which initializes the environment for unit tests, `bootForCli()` for scripts called from the command line, and so on.

```php
public static function bootForTests(): Configurator
{
	$configurator = self::boot();
	Tester\Environment::setup(); // Nette Tester initialization
	return $configurator;
}
```
