URL Routing
***********

/--div .[perex]
Routing is a two-way conversion between URL and presenter action. *Two-way* means that we can both determine what presenter URL links to, but also vice versa: generate URL for given action. This article contains:

- how to define routes and create links
- a few notes about SEO redirection
- how to debug defined routes
- how to create your own router

What is a Routing?
==================

Routing is a **two-way conversion** between **URL** and an **application request**.

- `Nette\Http\IRequest` (includes URL) -> `Nette\Application\Request`
- `Nette\Application\Request` -> absolute URL


Thanks to bidirectional routing you don't have to hardcode URLs into templates, but you simply link to [presenters' actions|presenters#toc-handling-presenter-actions] and framework generates the URLs for you:

/--html
{* creates URL to presenter 'Product' and action 'detail' *}
<a n:href="Product:detail $productId">product detail</a>
\--

Learn more about [creating links |presenters#link-creation].

Routing is a **separate application layer**. This allow you to very efficiently manipulate with the URL structure without the need to modify the application itself. It's simple to change routes anytime, while keeping the original addresses preserved and automatically redirect to the new variants. So hey, who's got that? :-)


SimpleRouter
============

Desired URL format is set by a *router*, which is usually defined in [bootstrap.php |presenters#index-php-bootstrap-php] file. The most plain implementation of router is [SimpleRouter | api:Nette\Application\Routers\SimpleRouter]. It can be used when there's no need for a specific URL format, or when `mod_rewrite` (or alternatives) is not available.

Addresses look like this:

/--
http://example.com/index.php?presenter=Product&action=detail&id=123
\--

The first argument of `SimpleRouter` constructor is a default presenter action, ie. action to be executed if we open for example `http://example.com/` without additional parameters. The declaration itself in a `bootstrap.php` file might look as follows: (`$container` is a [system DI container |configuring])

/--php
use Nette\Application\Routers\SimpleRouter;

// defaults to presenter Homepage and action default
$container->router = new SimpleRouter('Homepage:default');
\--


Route: for prettier URLs
========================

Human-friendly URLs (also more cool & prettier) are easier to remember and do help SEO((search engine optimalization)). Nette Framework keeps current trends in mind and fully meets developers' desires.

.[note]
All requests must be handled by `index.php` file. This can be accomplished e.g. by using Apache module `mod_rewrite` (see [how to enable mod_rewrite |troubleshooting#how-to-enable-mod-rewrite]) or Nginx's try_files (available by default).

Class [Route | api:Nette\Application\Routers\Route] can create addresses in pretty much any format one can though of. Let's start with a simple example generating a pretty URL for action `Product:default` with `id = 123`:

/--
http://example.com/product/detail/123
\--

The following snippet creates a `Route` object, passing path mask as the first argument and specifying default action in the second argument.

/--php
// action defaults to presenter Homepage and action default
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>[/<id>]', 'Homepage:default');
\--

This route is usable by all presenters and actions. Accepts paths such as `/article/edit/10` or `/catalog/list`, because the `id` part is wrapped in square brackets, which marks it as [optional | #optional sequences].

Because other parameters (`presenter` and `action`) do have default values (`Homepage` and `default`), they are optional too. If their value is the same as the default one, they are skipped while URL is generated. Link to `Product:default` generates only `http://example.com/product` and link to `Homepage:default` generates only `http://example.com/`.


Path Mask
---------

The simplest path mask consists only of a **static URL** and a target presenter action.

/--php
$route = new Route('products', 'Products:default');
\--

Most real masks however contain some **parameters**. Parameters are enclosed in angle brackets (e.g. `<year>`) and are passed to target presenter.

/--php
$route = new Route('history/<year>', 'History:view');
\--

Mask can also contain traditional GET arguments (query after a question mark). Neither validation expressions nor more complex structures are supported in this part of path mask, but you can set what key belongs to which variable:

/-- php
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action> ? id=<productId> & cat=<categoryId>', ...);
\--

.[note]
The parameters before a question mark are called *path parameters* and the parameters after a question mark are called *query parameters*.


/--comment
TERMINOLOGY ISSUE:
I've decided to use terminilogy by @Panda (http://edu.lynt.cz/course/download/?fileId=10). @DG uses "absolute path" for what I call here "relative to server document root" and "absolute URL" for what I call "absolute path". Any idea how to resolve this?
\--

Mask can not only describe path relative to application document root (web root), but can as well contain path relative to server document root (starts with a single slash) or absolute path with domain (starts with a double slash).

/--php
// relative to application document root (www directory)
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>', ...);

// relative to server document root
$route = new Route('/<presenter>/<action>', ...);

// absolute path including hostname
$route = new Route('//<subdomain>.example.com/<presenter>/<action>', ...);
\--

Absolute path mask may utilize the following variables:
- `%tld%` = top level domain, e.g. `com` or `org`
- `%domain%` = second level domain, e.g. `example.com`
- `%basePath%`

/--php
$route = new Route('//www.%domain%/%basePath%/<presenter>/<action>', ...);
\--


Route collection
----------------

Because we usually define more than one route, we wrap them into a [RouteList | api:Nette\Application\Routers\RouteList]. The following code snippet shows an [bootstrap.php |presenters#index-php-bootstrap-php] example: (`$container` is a [system DI container |configuring])

/--php
use Nette\Application\Routers\RouteList,
	Nette\Application\Routers\Route;

$router = new RouteList;
$router[] = new Route('article/<id>', 'Article:view');
$router[] = new Route('rss.xml', 'Feed:rss');
$router[] = new Route('<presenter>/<action>[/<id>]', 'Homepage:default');

$container->addService('router', $router);
// or shorter: $container->router = $router;
\--

.[note]
Unlike other frameworks, Nette does not require routes to be named.

It's importnat in which order routes are defined as they are tried from top to bottom. The rule of thumb here is that routes are declared from the most specific at the top to the most vague at the bottom. Keep in mind that huge amount of routes can negatively effect application speed, mostly when generating links. It's worth it to keep routes as simple as possible.

.[note]
If no route is found, an [BadRequestException | api:Nette\Application\BadRequestException] is thrown, which is shown as 404 Not Found to the user.

Default values
--------------

Each parameter may have defined default value in the mask:

/--php
$route = new Route('<presenter=Homepage>/<action=default>/<id=>');
\--

Or utilizing an array:

/--php
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>/<id>', array(
	'presenter' => 'Homepage',
	'action' => 'default',
	'id' => NULL,
));
\--


Validation expressions
----------------------

Regular expression conditions may be set for route parameters. For example let's set `id` to be only numerical, using `[0-9]+` regex:

/--php
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>[/<id [0-9]+>]',
	'Homepage:default');
\--

.[note]
Default validation expression is `[^/]+`, that is all characters but a slash. If parameter is supposed to match those as well, we can set condition to `.+`.


Optional sequences
------------------

Square brackets denote optional parts of mask. Any part of mask may be set optional, even with parameters:

/--php
$route = new Route('[<lang [a-z]{2}>/]<name>', 'Article:view');

// Accepts:
//    /en/download  => lang => en, name => download
//    /download     => lang => NULL, name => download
\--

Obviously, if parameter is inside an optional sequence, it's optional too and defaults to `NULL`. Sequence should define it's surroundings, in this case a slash which must follow an parameter, if set.
The technique may be used with optional language subdomains:

/--php
$route = new Route('//[<lang=en>.]example.com/<presenter>/<action>',
	'Homepage:default');
\--

Sequences may be freely nested and combined:

/--php
$route = new Route('[<lang [a-z]{2}>[-<sublang>]/]<name>[/page-<page=0>]',
	'Homepage:default');

// Accepts:
// 	/cs/hello
// 	/en-us/hello
// 	/hello
// 	/hello/page-12
\--


URL generator tries to keep the URL as short as possible (while unique), so what can be omitted is not used. That's why `index[.html]`  route generates `/index`. This behavior can be inverted by writing an exclamation mark after the leftmost square bracket that denotes the respective optional sequence:

/--php
// accepts both /hello and /hello.html, generates /hello
$route = new Route('<name>[.html]');

// accepts both /hello and /hello.html, generates /hello.html
$route = new Route('<name>[!.html]');
\--


Optional parameters (ie. parameters having default value) without square brackets do behave as if wrapped like this:

/--php
$route = new Route('<presenter=Homepage>/<action=default>/<id=>');

// equals to:
$route = new Route('[<presenter=Homepage>/[<action=default>/[<id>]]]');
\--

If we would like to change how the rightmost slashes are generated, that is instead of `/homepage/` get a `/homepage`, we can adjust the route:

/--php
$route = new Route('[<presenter=Homepage>[/<action=default>[/<id>]]]');
\--


Foo parameters
-------------

Foo parameters are similar to optional sequences, but they are used to match a regular expression. The following route matches `/index`, `/index.html`, `/index.htm` and `/index.php`:

/--php
$route = new Route('index<? \.html?|\.php|>', 'Homepage:default');
\--

It's also possible to explicitly define a string to be used while an address is generated (similar to setting default value to real parameters).


ONE_WAY flag
------------

One way routes are usually used to preserve old URLs functionality, when an application is rewritten. Flag `ONE_WAY` marks routes, which are not used for url generation.

/--php
// old URL /product-info?id=123
$router[] = new Route('product-info', 'Product:detail', Route::ONE_WAY);
// new URL /product/123
$router[] = new Route('product/<id>', 'Product:detail');
\--

Additionally the user is redirected to new URL, so search engines won't index your pages twice (see [#SEO a kanonizace]).



HTTPS
-----

Routes can be forced to secured HTTP by `SECURED` flag. That's useful for authentication pages, as well as administration etc. HTTPS must be supported by your hosting/server.

/--php
$route = new Route('admin/<presenter>/<action>',
	'Admin:default', Route::SECURED);
\--



Transformation and Translation
------------------------------

It's a good practice to write source code in english, but what if you need your application to run in a different environment? Simple routes such as:

/--php
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>/<id>', array(
	'presenter' => 'Homepage',
	'action' => 'default',
	'id' => NULL,
);
\--

will generate English URLs, `/product/123`, `/cart`, or `/catalog/view` etc. If we would like to translate those URLs, we can use a *dictionary*. We'd extend the route so:

/--php
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>/<id>', array(
	'presenter' => array(
		Route::VALUE => 'Homepage',
		Route::FILTER_TABLE => array(
			// translated string in URL => presenter
			'produkt' => 'Product',
			'kosik' => 'Cart',
			'katalog' => 'Catalog',
		),
	),
	'action' => 'default',
	'id' => NULL,
);
\--


.[tip]
Multiple keys may link to same presenter. That's how aliases are created. The last value is the canonical one (used for link generation).

Dictionaries may be applied to any parameter. Although it does not work as a filter, if a translation is not found, default value is used.

Besides setting dictionaries as arrays, it's possible to set a callback or a filter:

/--php
$route = new Route('<presenter>/<action>/<id>', array(
	'presenter' => array(
		Route::VALUE => 'Homepage',
		Route::FILTER_IN => 'filterInFunc',
		Route::FILTER_OUT => 'filterOutFunc',
	),
	'action' => 'default',
	'id' => NULL,
);
\--

Where `filterInFunc` and `filterOutFunc` are functions or methods that converts values between URL and what presenter gets. Each handles one direction.

Implicit *in-filter* is function [rawurldecode | php:rawurldecode] and *out-filter* is function [rawurlencode | php:rawurlencode], which escapes special characters (slashes, spaces, ...) for use in the URL.

In certain situations this behavior may be changed, for example let us have a parameter `path`, that can also contain slashes, so they're not converted to `%2F`:

/--php
// accepts http://files.example.com/path/to/my/file

$route = new Route('//files.example.com/<path .+>', array(
	'presenter' => 'File',
	'action' => 'default',
	'path' => array(
		Route::VALUE => NULL,
		Route::FILTER_IN => NULL,
		Route::FILTER_OUT => NULL,
	),
));
\--



Routing Debugger
================

We should keep it no secret that routes may seem to be magical for a while. But you will always appreciate value of Routing Debugger. It's a [Debugger bar | debugging] panel, which gives you a list of all parameters a router got and a list of all defined routers. It's turn on automatically, as long as the application runs in debug mode. It also shows on which presenter and action you are currently on.

SEO and canonization
====================

Framework increases SEO (search engine optimalization) as it prevents multiple URLs to link to different content (without a proper redirect). If more than one addresses link to same target (`/index` and `/index.html`), framework choses the first (makes it canonical) and redirect other to it with HTTP code 301. Thanks to that your page won't have duplicities on search engines and their rank won't be split.

This whole process is the so called canonication. Default (canonical) url is the one router generaets, that is first route in collection without `ONE_WAY` flag.

Canonization is done by [Presenter | api:Nette\Application\UI\Presenter] and it's switched on by default. You may disable it by setting `$presenter->autoCanonicalize = FALSE`.

.[note]
Ajax and POST requests are not redirected as user would suffer either a data loss, or it would yell no additional SEO value.


Modularity
==========

If we want to add separate modules into our application that have their own routes, for example a discussion forum, we may define routes elsewhere, possibly in `createRoutes()` method:

/--php
class Forum
{
	static function createRoutes($router, $prefix)
	{
		$router[] = new Route($prefix . 'index.php', 'Forum:Homepage:default');
		$router[] = new Route($prefix . 'admin.php', 'Forum:Admin:default');
		...
	}
}
\--

"Routing-in" the forum into existing application can be as easy as calling this method: (`bootstrap.php`)

/--php
$container->addService('router', function() {
	$router = new RouteList;
	// our routes
	...

	// adding forum module
	Forum::createRoutes($router, '//forum.example.com/');
	return $router;
});
\--


Custom router
=============

If these offered routes do not fit your needs, you may create your own router and add it to your *router collection*. Router is nothing more but an implementation of [IRouter | api:Nette\Application\IRouter] with it's two methods:

/-- php
class MyRouter implements Nette\Application\IRouter
{
	function match(Nette\Http\IRequest $httpRequest){ }

	function constructUrl(Nette\Application\Request $appRequest, Nette\Http\Url $refUrl) { }
}
\--

Method `match` does process current [$httpRequest | api:Nette\Http\Request] (which offers more than just the URL) into internal [Nette\Application\Request | api:Nette\Application\Request] which contains presenter name and it's parameters. If original request could not be processed, return NULL.

Method `constructUrl` generates absolute URL from internal request, possibly utilizing information from `$refUrl` argument.

Possibilities of custom routers are unlimited, for example it's possible to implement a router based on database records.
