Content Security Policy
=======================

If your site uses Content Security Policy, you'll need to add `'nonce-<value>'` to `script-src` and eventually the same nonce to `style-src` for Tracy to work properly. Some 3rd plugins may require additional directives. Avoid adding `'unsafe-inline'` & `'unsafe-eval'` in production mode, if you can.

Configuration example for [Nette Framework |nette:configuring]:

```neon
http:
	csp:
		script-src: nonce
		style-src: nonce
```


Faster Loading
==============

The basic integration is straightforward, however if you have slow blocking scripts in web page, they can slow the Tracy loading.
The solution is to place `<?php Tracy\Debugger::renderLoader() ?>` into your template before
any scripts:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<title>...<title>
	<?php Tracy\Debugger::renderLoader() ?>
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/style.css">
	<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"></script>
</head>
```


AJAX and Redirected Requests
============================

Tracy can display Debug bar and Bluescreens for AJAX requests and redirects. Tracy creates its own sessions, stores data in its own temporary files, and uses a `tracy-session` cookie.

Tracy can also be configured to use a native PHP session, which is started before Tracy is turned on:

```php
session_start();
Debugger::setSessionStorage(new Tracy\NativeSession);
Debugger::enable();
```

In case starting a session requires more complex initialization, you can start Tracy immediately (so that it can handle any errors that occur) and then initialize the session handler
and finally inform Tracy that the session is ready to be used using the `dispatch()` function:

```php
Debugger::setSessionStorage(new Tracy\NativeSession);
Debugger::enable();

// followed by session initialization
// and start the session
session_start();

Debugger::dispatch();
```

The `setSessionStorage()` function has existed since version 2.9, before that Tracy always used the native PHP session.


Custom Logger
=============

We can create a custom logger to log errors, uncatched exceptions, and also be called by `Tracy\Debugger::log()`. Logger implements the interface [api:Tracy\ILogger].

```php
use Tracy\ILogger;

class SlackLogger implements ILogger
{
	public function log($value, $priority = ILogger::INFO)
	{
		// sends a request to Slack
	}
}
```

And then we activate it:

```php
Tracy\Debugger::setLogger(new SlackLogger);
```

If we use the full Nette Framework, we can set it in the NEON configuration file:

```neon
services:
	tracy.logger: SlackLogger
```


nginx
=====

If Tracy does not work on nginx, it is probably misconfigured. If there is something like

```nginx
try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php;
```

change it to

```nginx
try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php$is_args$args;
```
