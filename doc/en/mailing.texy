Sending E-mails
***************

<div class=perex>

Are you going to send emails such as newsletters or order confirmations? Nette Framework provides the necessary tools with a very nice API. We will show:

- how to create an email, including attachments
- how to send it
- how to combine emails and templates

</div>

Installation:

```shell
composer require nette/mail
```

Creating Emails
===============

Email is a [api:Nette\Mail\Message] object:

```php
use Nette\Mail\Message;

$mail = new Message;
$mail->setFrom('John <john@example.com>')
	->addTo('peter@example.com')
	->addTo('jack@example.com')
	->setSubject('Order Confirmation')
	->setBody("Hello, Your order has been accepted.");
```

.[note]
All parameters must be encoded in UTF-8.

In addition to specifying recipients with the `addTo()` method, you can also specify the recipient of copy with `addCc()`, or the recipient of blind copy with `addBcc()`. All these methods, including `setFrom()`, accepts addressee in three ways:

```php
$mail->setFrom('john.doe@example.com');
$mail->setFrom('john.doe@example.com', 'John Doe');
$mail->setFrom('John Doe <john.doe@example.com>');
```

The body of the email in HTML is set by the `setHtmlBody()` method:

```php
$mail->setHtmlBody('<b>Sample HTML</b> <img src="background.gif">');
```

If an HTML e-mail has no plain-text alternative, it will be automatically generated. And if it has no subject set, it will be taken from the `<title>` element.


Embedded Images
---------------

Embedded images can be inserted into an email using the `$mail->addEmbeddedFile('background.gif')` method, but this is not necessary. Why? Because the Nette Framework finds and inserts all files referenced in the HTML code automatically. This behavior can be turned off by specifying `false` as the second parameter of the `setHtmlBody()` method, in this parameter it is also possible to pass the absolute path to the image folder.


Attachments
-----------

Adding attachments to the e-mail is simple. In order to attach a file, we use `addAttachment()` method:

```php
// attaches example.zip to the e-mail
$mail->addAttachment('path/to/example.zip');

// attaches new example.txt file with "Hello John!" in it
$mail->addAttachment('example.txt', 'Hello John!');

// attaches example.zip renamed to info.zip
$mail->addAttachment('info.zip', file_get_contents('path/to/example.zip'));
```

Can be sending e-mails even easier?


Templates
=========

The real power comes in combination with [Latte templating system |latte:]:

```php
$latte = new Latte\Engine;
$params = [
	'orderId' => 123,
];

$mail = new Message;
$mail->setFrom('John <john@example.com>')
	->addTo('jack@example.com')
	->setHtmlBody($latte->renderToString('email.latte', $params));
```

File `email.latte`:

```html
<html>
<head>
	<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
	<title>Order Confirmation</title>
	<style>
	body {
		background: url("background.png")
	}
	</style>
</head>
<body>
	<p>Hello,</p>

	<p>Your order number {$orderId} has been accepted.</p>
</body>
</html>
```


Using in Nette Application
--------------------------

Latte template system at its base does not know the `{link}` macro or the `n:href` attribute (and some others, such as the filter translate).
These are supplemented by the `TemplateFactory` class from the `nette/application` package in conjunction with the presenter.
To be able to create links in the template email, let the `TemplateFactory` to create a template. A presenter
we will replace with `LinkGenerator` object, which can create links. We pass both objects through the constructor and create a template
in the `createTemplate ()` method:

```php
class MailSender
{
	/** @var Nette\Application\LinkGenerator */
	private $linkGenerator;

	/** @var Nette\Bridges\ApplicationLatte\TemplateFactory */
	private $templateFactory;

	public function sendEmail(): void
	{
		$template = $this->createTemplate();

		$template->name = $order->getName();
		$template->setFile(__DIR__ . '/email.latte');

		$mail = new Message;
		$mail->setHtmlBody($template->renderToString());
	}

	protected function createTemplate(): Nette\Application\UI\ITemplate
	{
		$template = $this->templateFactory->createTemplate();
		$template->getLatte()->addProvider('uiControl', $this->linkGenerator);
		return $template;
	}
}
```

In the template, link is created like in a normal template. All links create over LinkGenerator are absolute:

```html
<a n:href="Presenter:action">Link</a>
```


Sending Emails
==============

Mailer is class responsible for sending e-mails. It implements the [api:Nette\Mail\Mailer] interface and several ready-made mailers are available.

Example of use:

```php
$mailer = new Nette\Mail\SendmailMailer;
$mailer->send($mail);
```

The framework automatically adds a `Nette\Mail\Mailer` service based on [configuration |configuring#Mailing] to the DI container, which you get by passing it using [dependency injection |di-usage].



SendmailMailer
--------------

The default mailer is SendmailMailer which uses PHP function [php:mail].

If you want to set `returnPath` and the server still overwrites it, use `$commandArgs`:

```php
$mailer->commandArgs = '-fmy@email.com';
```

SmtpMailer
----------

To send mail via the SMTP server, use `SmtpMailer`.

```php
$mailer = new Nette\Mail\SmtpMailer([
	'host' => 'smtp.gmail.com', //  if not set, php.ini settings will be used
	'username' => 'franta@gmail.com',
	'password' => '*****',
	'secure' => 'ssl',
]);
$mailer->send($mail);
```

Apart from options above `SmtpMailer` also offers more customisation options:

* `port` - If not set, will be guessed based on `secure` option: 465 for value `ssl`, 25 otherwise.
* `context` - Allows to fine-grain connection according to "SSL context options":https://www.php.net/manual/en/context.ssl.php. Contains an array of individual options.
* `timeout` - Timeout for SMTP connection
* `persistent` - Use persistent connection
* `clientHost` - Client designation


FallbackMailer
--------------

It does not send email but sends them through a set of mailers. If one mailer fails, it repeats the attempt at the next one. If the last one fails, it starts again from the first one.

```php
$mailer = new Nette\Mail\FallbackMailer([
	$smtpMailer,
	$backupSmtpMailer,
	$sendmailMailer
]);
$mailer->send($mail);
```

Other parameters in the constructor include the number of repeat and waiting time (in miliseconds).


DKIM
====

DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is a trustworthy email technology that also helps detect spoofed messages. The sent message is signed by the SMTP server with the private key of the sender's domain and this signature is stored in the email header.
The recipient's server compares this signature with the public key stored in the domain's DNS records. By matching the signature, it is shown that the email actually originated from the sender's domain and that the message was not modified during the transmission of the message.

```php
$options = [
	'domain' => 'nette.org',
	'selector' => 'dkim',
	'privateKey' => file_get_contents('../dkim/dkim.key'),
	'passPhrase' => '****',
];

$mailer = new Nette\Mail\SendmailMailer; // or SmtpMailer
$mailer->setSigner(new Nette\Mail\DkimSigner($options));
$mailer->send($mail);
```
