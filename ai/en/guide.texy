Vibe Coding
***********

<div class=perex>

Vibe coding is a new way of programming where you describe what you want in plain language and AI writes the code for you. Nette is ideal for this style of development – strict dependency injection, strong typing, and clear conventions allow AI to generate precise, working code.

- **Claude Code Plugin** – Deep Nette knowledge for Claude Code users
- **Best Practices** – Proven patterns for effective AI collaboration

What is Vibe Coding?
====================

"The hottest new programming language is English."

That's the core idea behind vibe coding – instead of writing every line yourself, you describe your intent and let AI handle the implementation. Want a presenter for managing products? Just say so. Need a form with validation? Describe the fields and rules.

But here's the important part: **AI doesn't replace programmers**. It's a powerful assistant that accelerates routine work:

- Generate boilerplate code (presenters, forms, entities) in seconds
- Understand existing code and explain how it works
- Find bugs and suggest fixes
- Write tests based on your implementation

The catch? AI doesn't truly know your application. It sees only what you show it and guesses the rest based on patterns it learned during training. That's where Nette AI tools come in.


Why Nette is Perfect for AI
===========================

Not all frameworks work equally well with AI. Nette has properties that make it exceptionally suited for AI-assisted development:

**Strict Dependency Injection**

In Nette, all services are registered in the DI container. AI can inspect exactly what services exist and how they're configured – no guessing required.

**Strong Typing**

Type hints on methods and properties mean AI generates code that actually works. Fewer runtime errors, less debugging.

**Clear Conventions**

Presenters, components, templates – everything has its place. AI can follow these patterns and produce code that looks like it was written by an experienced Nette developer.

The key principle:

.**"Without MCP, AI guesses. With MCP, AI knows."**


How It Works
============

The magic happens through **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** – an open standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources. Instead of guessing based on training data, AI can query your actual application state.

Here's the flow:

1. **You** describe what you want: "Create an entity for the product table"
2. **AI tool** (Claude, Cursor, etc.) needs to know your database schema
3. **MCP Inspector** queries your application and returns the actual schema
4. **AI** generates code that matches your real database

No hallucinations. No guessing. Just accurate code.


Nette AI Tools
==============


MCP Inspector
-------------

The core of Nette's AI integration. MCP Inspector is an MCP server that gives **any compatible AI tool** real-time access to your application:

| What AI Can See | Examples |
|-----------------|----------|
| **DI Container** | Services, parameters, extensions |
| **Database** | Tables, columns, relationships |
| **Router** | Routes, URL matching, generation |
| **Tracy** | Exceptions, warnings, logs |

MCP Inspector works with Claude Code, Cursor, VS Code with Continue, and any other tool that supports the MCP protocol.

Claude Code Plugin
------------------

For users of Claude Code, there's an additional plugin that gives Claude deep knowledge of Nette conventions. It includes 10 specialized "skills" that activate automatically:

| Skill | What It Covers |
|-------|----------------|
| nette-architecture | Presenters, modules, directory structure |
| nette-database | Database Explorer, entities, queries |
| nette-forms | Controls, validation, rendering |
| latte-templates | Syntax, filters, security |
| + 6 more... | [See complete list |claude-code] |

The plugin also automatically validates Latte templates and NEON files after every edit.

Other AI Tools
--------------

MCP Inspector works with any MCP-compatible tool. Setup guides for additional tools are coming soon:

- **Cursor** – Popular AI-first code editor
- **VS Code + Continue** – Open-source AI coding assistant
- **Gemini CLI** – Google's command-line AI tool


Getting Started
===============

Ready to try vibe coding with Nette? The setup takes about 10 minutes:

1. **Choose your AI tool** – We recommend Claude Code for the best Nette experience
2. **Install MCP Inspector** – The core that gives AI access to your application
3. **Start coding** – Describe what you want and let AI help
