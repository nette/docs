Getting Started with Tracy
**************************

<div class=perex>

Tracy library is a useful helper for everyday PHP programmers. It helps you to:

- quickly detect and correct errors
- log errors
- dump variables
- measure execution time of scripts/queries
- see memory consumption

</div>


PHP is a perfect language for making hardly detectable errors because it gives great flexibility to programmers. Tracy\Debugger is more valuable because of that. It is an ultimate tool among the diagnostic ones.

If you are meeting Tracy for the first time, believe me, your life starts to be divided into one before the Tracy and the one with her. Welcome to the good part!


Installation and Requirements
=============================

The best way how to install Tracy is to [download the latest package](https://github.com/nette/tracy/releases) or use Composer:

```shell
composer require tracy/tracy
```

Alternatively, you can download the whole package or [tracy.phar |https://github.com/nette/tracy/releases] file.


Usage
=====

Tracy is activated by calling the `Tracy\Debugger::enable()' method as soon as possible at the beginning of the program, before any output is sent:

```php
use Tracy\Debugger;

require 'vendor/autoload.php'; // alternatively tracy.phar

Debugger::enable();
```

The first thing you'll notice on the page is the Tracy Bar in the bottom right corner. If you don't see it, it may mean that Tracy is running in production mode.
This is because Tracy is only visible on localhost for security reasons. To test if it works, you can temporarily put it into development mode using the `Debugger::enable(Debugger::Development)` parameter.


Tracy Bar
=========

The Tracy Bar is a floating panel. It is displayed in the bottom right corner of a page. You can move it using the mouse. It will remember its position after the page reloading.

[* tracy-bar.webp *]:https://nette.github.io/tracy/tracy-debug-bar.html

You can add other useful panels to the Tracy Bar. You can find interesting ones in [addons |https://componette.org] or you can [create your own |extensions].

If you do not want to show Tracy Bar, set:

```php
Debugger::$showBar = false;
```


Visualization of Errors and Exceptions
======================================

Surely, you know how PHP reports errors: there is something like this in the page source code:

/--pre .{font-size: 90%}
<b>Parse error</b>:  syntax error, unexpected '}' in <b>HomePresenter.php</b> on line <b>15</b>
\--

or uncaught exception:

/--pre .{font-size: 90%}
<b>Fatal error</b>:  Uncaught Nette\MemberAccessException: Call to undefined method Nette\Application\UI\Form::addTest()? in /sandbox/vendor/nette/utils/src/Utils/ObjectMixin.php:100
Stack trace:
#0 /sandbox/vendor/nette/utils/src/Utils/Object.php(75): Nette\Utils\ObjectMixin::call(Object(Nette\Application\UI\Form), 'addTest', Array)
#1 /sandbox/app/forms/SignFormFactory.php(32): Nette\Object->__call('addTest', Array)
#2 /sandbox/app/presenters/SignPresenter.php(21): App\Forms\SignFormFactory->create()
#3 /sandbox/vendor/nette/component-model/src/ComponentModel/Container.php(181): App\Presenters\SignPresenter->createComponentSignInForm('signInForm')
#4 /sandbox/vendor/nette/component-model/src/ComponentModel/Container.php(139): Nette\ComponentModel\Container->createComponent('signInForm')
#5 /sandbox/temp/cache/latte/15206b353f351f6bfca2c36cc.php(17): Nette\ComponentModel\Co in <b>/sandbox/vendor/nette/utils/src/Utils/ObjectMixin.php</b> on line <b>100</b><br />
\--

It is not so easy to navigate through this output. If you enable Tracy, both errors and exceptions are displayed in a completely different form:

[* tracy-exception.webp .{url:-} *]

The error message literally screams. You can see a part of the source code with the highlighted line where the error occurred. A message clearly explains an error. The entire site is [interactive, try it](https://nette.github.io/tracy/tracy-exception.html).

And you know what? Fatal errors are captured and displayed in the same way. No need to install any extension (click for live example):

[* tracy-error.webp .{url:-} *]

Errors like a typo in a variable name or an attempt to open a nonexistent file generate reports of E_NOTICE or E_WARNING level. These can be easily overlooked and/or can be completely hidden in a web page graphic layout. Let Tracy manage them:

[* tracy-notice2.webp *]:https://nette.github.io/tracy/tracy-debug-bar.html

Or they may be displayed like errors:

```php
Debugger::$strictMode = true; // display all errors
Debugger::$strictMode = E_ALL & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_USER_DEPRECATED; // all errors except deprecated notices
```

[* tracy-notice.webp .{url:-} *]

Note: Tracy when activated changes the error reporting level to E_ALL. If you want to change this, do so after calling `enable()`.


Development vs Production Mode
==============================

As you can see, Tracy is quite talkative, which can be appreciated in the development environment, while on the production server it would cause a disaster. That's because no debugging information should be displayed there. Tracy therefore has **environment auto-detection** and if the example is run on a live server, the error will be logged instead of displayed, and the visitor will only see a user-friendly message:

[* tracy-error2.webp .{url:-} *]

Production mode suppresses the display of all debugging information sent out using [dump() |dumper], and of course also all error messages generated by PHP. So if you have forgotten some `dump($obj)` in the code, you don't have to worry, nothing will be displayed on the production server.

How does mode auto-detection work? The mode is development if the application is running on localhost (i.e., IP address `127.0.0.1` or `::1`) and there is no proxy (i.e., its HTTP header). Otherwise, it runs in production mode.

If you want to enable development mode in other cases, for example for developers accessing from a specific IP address, you can specify it as a parameter of the `enable()` method:

```php
Debugger::enable('23.75.345.200'); // you can also provide an array of IP addresses
```

We definitely recommend combining the IP address with a cookie. Store a secret token, e.g., `secret1234`, in the `tracy-debug` cookie, and in this way, activate the development mode only for developers accessing from a specific IP address who have the mentioned token in the cookie:

```php
Debugger::enable('secret1234@23.75.345.200');
```

You can also directly set the development/production mode using the `Debugger::Development` or `Debugger::Production` constants as a parameter of the `enable()` method.

.[note]
If you use the Nette Framework, take a look at how to [set the mode for it |application:bootstrap#Development vs Production Mode], and it will then also be used for Tracy.


Error Logging
=============

In production mode, Tracy automatically logs all errors and exceptions to a text log. In order for logging to take place, you need to set the absolute path to the log directory to the `$logDirectory` variable or pass it as the second parameter to `enable()` method:

```php
Debugger::$logDirectory = __DIR__ . '/log';
```

Error logging is extremely useful. Imagine that all users of your application are actually beta testers who do top-notch work in finding errors for free, and you would be foolish to throw their valuable reports away unnoticed into the trash bin.

If you need to log your own messages or caught exceptions, use the method `log()`:

```php
Debugger::log('Unexpected error'); // text message

try {
	criticalOperation();
} catch (Exception $e) {
	Debugger::log($e); // log exception
	// or
	Debugger::log($e, Debugger::ERROR); // also sends an email notification
}
```

If you want Tracy to log PHP errors like `E_NOTICE` or `E_WARNING` with detailed information (HTML report), set `Debugger::$logSeverity`:

```php
Debugger::$logSeverity = E_NOTICE | E_WARNING;
```

For a real professional the error log is a crucial source of information and he or she wants to be notified about any new error immediately. Tracy helps him. She is capable of sending an email for every new error record. The variable $email identifies where to send these e-mails:

```php
Debugger::$email = 'admin@example.com';
```

If you use the entire Nette Framework, you can set this and others in the [configuration file |nette:configuring].

To protect your e-mail box from flood, Tracy sends **only one message** and creates a file `email-sent`. When a developer receives the e-mail notification, he checks the log, corrects his application and deletes the `email-sent` monitoring file. This activates the e-mail sending again.


Opening Files in the Editor
===========================

When the error page is displayed, you can click on file names and they will open in your editor with the cursor on the corresponding line. Files can also be created (action `create file`) or bug fixed in them (action `fix it`). In order to do this, you need to [configure the browser and the system |open-files-in-ide].
