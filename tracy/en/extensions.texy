Tracy is a great tool for debugging your application. However, you sometimes need more information than Tracy offers. You'll learn about:

- Creating your own Debugger bar panels
- Creating your own Bluescreen extensions

Debugger Bar extensions
=======================

Creating new extension for Debugger Bar is simple. You need to implement `Tracy\IBarPanel` interface with methods `getTab()` and `getPanel()`. The methods must return HTML code of a tab (small label on Debugger Bar) and a panel (pop-up displayed after clicking on the tab). If `getPanel()` returns nothing, only tab will be displayed. If `getTab()` returns nothing, nothing is displayed and `getPanel()` will not be called.

```php
class ExamplePanel implements Tracy\IBarPanel
{
	public function getTab()
	{
		return ...;
	}

	public function getPanel()
	{
		return ...;
	}
}
```

Registration
------------

Registration is done by calling `Tracy\Bar::addPanel()`:

```php
Tracy\Debugger::getBar()->addPanel(new ExamplePanel);
```

or you can simply register your panel in application configuration:

```neon
tracy:
	bar:
		- ExamplePanel
```

Tab HTML code
-------------

Should look something like this:

```html
<span title="Explaining tooltip">
	<svg>....</svg>
	<span class="tracy-label">Title</span>
</span>
```

Image should be in format SVG. If you don't need tooltip, you can leave `<span>` out.

Panel HTML code
---------------

Should look something like this:

```html
<h1>Title</h1>

<div class="tracy-inner">
<div class="tracy-inner-container">
	... content ...
</div>
</div>
```

Title should either be the same as in tab or contain additional information.

One extension can be registered multiple times, so it's recommended not to use `id` attribute for styling. You can use classes, preferably in `tracy-addons-<class-name>[-<optional>]` format. When creating CSS, it's better to use `#tracy-debug .class`, because such rule has higher priority than reset.

Default styles
--------------

In the panel, elements `<a>`, `<table>`, `<pre>`, `<code>` have default styles. You can also use `.tracy-collapsed` for hidden elements. For creating a link for hiding or displaying other element, connect them with `href` and `id` attributes.

```html
<a href='#tracy-addons-className-{$counter}'>Detail&nbsp;&#x25ba;</a>

<div id="tracy-addons-className-{$counter}">...</div>

```

Use static counter to prevent duplicate IDs on one page.

Bluescreen extensions
=====================

You can add your own exception visualizations or panels, which will appear on the bluescreen.

Extension is made like this:
```php
Tracy\Debugger::getBlueScreen()->addPanel(function (?Throwable $e) { // catched exception
	return [
		'tab' => '...Title...',
		'panel' => '...content...',
	];
});
```

The function is called twice, first time the exception is passed in `$e` and the returned panel is rendered at the top of the page. If the function returns nothing, panel won't be displayed. Second time it is called with `null` and the returned panel is rendered under the callstack. If the function returns a `'bottom' => true` key in the array, the panel will be drawn at the very bottom.
