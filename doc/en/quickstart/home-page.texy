Home Page
**********

.[perex]
Let’s create the home page displaying your recent posts.


Before we start, you should know at least some basics about Model-View-Presenter design pattern (similar to MVC((Model-View-Controller))):

- **Model** - data manipulation layer. It is completely separated from the rest of the application. It only communicates with presenters.

- **View** - a front-end definition layer. It renders requested data to the user using templates.

- **Presenter** (or Controller) - a connection layer. Presenter connects Model and View. Handles requests, asks Model for data and then passes them to the current View.


In case of a very simple application like our blog, the Model layer will actually consist only of the database itself - we don't need any extra PHP code for it. We only need to create Presenter and View layers. In Nette, each Presenter has its own Views, so we will continue with both simultaneously.

You can find the [source code on GitHub |https://github.com/nette/quickstart].



Creating the Database with Adminer
==================================

To store the data, we will use the MySQL database, because it is the most common choice among web developers. But if you don’t like it, feel free to use a database of your choice.

Let’s prepare the database which will store our blog posts. We can start very simply - just with a single table for posts.

To create the database we can use "Adminer":[http://adminer.org/], which is preinstalled in the Sandbox. You can find it at the following URL: `http://localhost/nette-blog/www/adminer/`. If you are using any other database management tool already and you’re comfortable with it, feel free to use it.


Let’s open Adminer and create a new database called `quickstart`.

Create a new table named `posts` and add these columns:
- `id` int, click on autoincrement (AI)
- `title` varchar, length 255
- `content` text
- `created_at` timestamp

It should look like this:

[* adminer-posts.png *]

.[tip]
It’s very important to use the **InnoDB** table storage. You will see the reason later. For now, just choose that and submit. You can hit Save now.

Try adding some sample blog posts before we implement the capability of adding new posts directly from our application. Actually, we wouldn't need to program adding / editing / removing posts, you could easily add new posts in Adminer and have the blog working.



Connecting to the Database
==========================

Now, when the database is created and we have some posts in it, it’s the right time to display them on our new shiny page.

First, we need to tell our application which database to use. All the configuration, including the database configuration, is stored in `/app/config/config.neon`. Set the connection DSN((Data Source Name)) and your credentials. It should look like this:

/---neon
	nette:
		database:
			dsn: 'mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=quickstart'
			user: root
			password: *enter password here*
\---

.[note]
Be aware of indenting while editing this file. [NEON |http://ne-on.org] format accepts both spaces and tabs but not both together! Configuration file in the Sandbox uses tabs as default.



Injecting the Database Connection
=============================

The presenter (located in `app/presenters/HomepagePresenter.php`), which will list the articles, needs a database connection. To receive it, write a constructor like this:

/--php
class HomepagePresenter extends BasePresenter
{
	/** @var Nette\Database\Connection */
	private $database;

	public function __construct(Nette\Database\Connection $database)
	{
		$this->database = $database;
	}

	// ...

}
\--



Loading Posts from the Database
===============================

Now let’s fetch the posts from the database and pass them to the template, which will then render the HTML code. This is what the so called *render* method is for

/--php
	public function renderDefault()
	{
		$this->template->posts = $this->database->table('posts')
			->order('created_at DESC')
			->limit(5);
	}
\--

The presenter now has one render method `renderDefault()` that passes data to a view called `default`. Presenter templates can be found in `app/templates/{PresenterName}/{viewName}.latte`, so in this case the template will be located in `app/templates/Homepage/default.latte`. In the template, a variable named `$posts` is now available.


Template
========

There is a generic template for the whole page (called *layout*, with header, stylesheets, footer, ...) and then specific templates for each view (e.g. for displaying the list of blog posts), which can override some of layout template parts.

By default, the layout template is located in `app/templates/@layout.latte`, which contains

/--html
{include #content}
\--

This line includes a named block called `#content`, which is defined in the specific template.

You can try to refresh your browser now, even though you haven’t created the template yet. Nette will display an error message:

/--
Page not found. Missing template '…/app/templates/Homepage/default.latte'.
\--

Now, create the missing file and insert the minimum required code:

/--html
{block #content}
\--

It defines the *content* block, which will be inserted into the layout. If you refresh the browser, you’ll see an empty page (with only HTML header and footer).

Let’s display the blog posts - add the following code to the template, after the block definition:

/--html
<h1 n:block="title">My awesome blog</h1>

{foreach $posts as $post}
<div class="post">
	<div class="date">{$post->created_at|date:'F j, Y'}</div>

	<h2><a href="{link Post:show $post->id}">{$post->title}</a></h2>

	<div>{$post->content}</div>
</div>
{/foreach}
\--

If you refresh your browser, you’ll see the list of your blog posts. The list isn't very fancy or colorful, so feel free to add some [shiny CSS |https://github.com/nette/quickstart/blob/master/www/css/screen.css].

The `{foreach}` macro iterates over all posts passed to the template in `$posts` variable and displays a piece of HTML code for each post. Just like a PHP code would.

The `{link}` macro generates a URL which leads to the `Post:show` action (which we are about to create). It also passes ID of the post as an argument. We’ll get to it in a minute.

The `|date:` thing is called a helper. Helpers are used to format the output. This one transforms the given timestamp (e.g. `2013-04-12`) to a nice and readable date format (`April 12, 2013`). You can find more predefined "helpers":/default-helpers in the documentation or you can add your own if you need to.

One more thing. We can make the code a little bit shorter and thus simpler. We can replace *Latte macros* with *n: attributes* like this:

/--html
<div n:foreach="$posts as $post" class="post">
	<div class="date">{$post->created_at|date:'F j, Y'}</div>

	<h2><a n:href="Post:show $post->id">{$post->title}</a></h2>

	<div>{$post->content}</div>
</div>
\--

The `n:foreach`, simply wraps the *div* with a *foreach* block (it does exactly the same thing as the previous block of code).

The `n:href` attribute is an alias for the `{link}` macro.


Summary
=======

We have a very simple MySQL database with some blog posts in it. The application connects to the database and displays a simple list of the posts.
