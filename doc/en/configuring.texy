Framework Configuration
***********************

.[perex]
An overview of all configuration options in Nette Framework.

Nette application is easily configured using [configuration files |bootstrap#Configuration files]. They are usually written in NEON format. Have fun [trying out |https://ne-on.org] the syntax.


Access Control
==============

By filling in `users` option you create `SimpleAuthenticator`, by defining `roles` or `resources` you create `Nette\Security\Permission` authorizator. More in [User Authorization and Privileges |access-control].

/--neon
	security:
		debugger: true  # debugger bar panel

		users:
			johndoe: secretpassword

		roles:
			guest:
			member:
			admin: [member]  # admin extends member

		resources:
			file:
\--


Application
===========

Errors
------

The `errorPresenter` specifies the presenter which is invoked when an error occurs. We can find [an example |https://github.com/nette/sandbox/blob/v2.4/app/presenters/ErrorPresenter.php] in the sandbox.
Parameter `catchExceptions` decides if the error presenter will be invoked. By changing this value to `true` in the debug mode we can test functionality of the error presenter.

/--neon
	application:
		debugger: true # shows panel in Tracy bar
		errorPresenter:  ...  # default: Nette:Error
		catchExceptions: ...  # default: enabled in production mode
		silentLinks: ...      # default: false
\--

Option `silentLinks` specifies Nette behaviour in the debug mode when a link generation fails. With `false` value Nette will trigger `E_USER_WARNING`. Changing this configuration option to `true` will suppress this error. In production environment, E_USER_WARNING will be always triggered.
We can also adjust this behaviour using class property [Presenter::$invalidLinkMode|#Invalid links].

Mapping
-------

Default value: `*: *Module\*Presenter` (in the Sandbox change to `*: App\*Module\Presenters\*Presenter`)

This parameter contains an array with rules for converting presenter name to the class name. In the key we define a module name or `*` as a fallback for other modules. The value contains the rule mask:

/--neon
application:
	mapping:
		Admin: App\Admin\*Module\*Presenter
		*: App\*Module\Presenters\*Presenter
\--


The presenter `Front:Blog:Article` is contained inside the Front module. Since this module has no explicit mapping, the mapping with asterisk will be used and the class will be called `App\FrontModule\BlogModule\Presenters\ArticlePresenter`. The presenter `Admin:User:Edit` is part of the `Admin` module which has separate mapping so the name of the presenter class will be `App\Admin\UserModule\EditPresenter` (note that since the `Admin` is already in the mapping definition, it will be stripped from the resulting class name).

Automatic registration of presenters
------------------------------------

Nette automatically registers presenters as services. This step improves presenter creation speed. There are few configuration options that adjust where and how Nette looks for them.

The `scanComposer` specifies if Nette should look for presenters in the Composer classmap. The `scanFilter` specifies the string which must be included in the file and class name.

Value `scanDir` contains an array with directories where Nette looks for the presenters. If we specify another value in the configuration, it will be merged with the default one `%appDir%`:

/--neon
application:
	scanComposer: no  # default: true
	scanFilter: Page  # default: Presenter
	scanDirs:
		- foo
\--

In this case `scanDirs` will contain values `%appDir%` and `foo`. If we want to disable or overwrite this configuration option, we need to use `!` modifier:

/--neon
application:
	scanDirs!:
		- foo
\--

Now `scanDirs` will contain only `foo`.


Database
========

Mandatory item is only `dsn`:

/--neon
	database:
			dsn: "sqlite2:%appDir%/models/demo.db"
\--

The Framework creates not only the `Nette\Database\Connection` object, but also sets the auxiliary objects as a reflection & cache and adds a panel to the Tracy bar in the developer mode.

Other settings are as follows:

/--neon
	database:
		dsn: 'mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test'
		user: root
		password: password
		options:
			PDO::MYSQL_ATTR_COMPRESS: true
			lazy: true  # establish a connection when it is needed for the first time
			driverClass:  .... # class database driver
		debugger: true         # show panel in Tracy baru
		explain:  true         # show query explains in Tracy bar
		autowired: true # enabled for first defined connection
		conventions: discovered # or 'static' or class name, the default is 'discovered'
\--

In the `options` option, you can specify additional values ​​found in the PDO drivers documentation.

In the configuration file, we can define more than one database connection:

/--neon
	database:
		main:
			dsn: 'mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test'
			user: root
			password: password

		anotherDb:
			dsn: 'sqlite::memory:'
\--

Each connection defined in this way creates two services - the `Nette\Database\Connection` object named as `database.[NAME].connection` (in our case, `database.main.connection` and `database.anotherDb.connection`) and the `Nette\Database\Context` object named as `database.[NAME].context` that is used when working with the [Database Explorer] layer.

First connection services are passed through autowiring, however we can turn it off by `autowired: no`, and turn on for another connection via `autowired: yes`.

Other non-autowired connections can be passed explicitly in the configuration:

/--neon
services:
	- UserManager(@database.anotherDb.connection) # or @database.anotherDb.context
\--


DI Container
============

/--neon
	di:
		debugger: false  # disables DI panel
\--


Forms
=====

You can change default validation error messages.

/--neon
	forms:
		messages:
			EQUAL: 'Please enter %s.'
			FILLED: 'Please complete mandatory field.'
			MIN_LENGTH: 'Please enter a value of at least %d characters.'
			EMAIL: '%label must be valid e-mail'
\--


HTTP Headers
============

/--neon
	http:
		frames: ...               # header X-Frame-Options

	headers:
		X-Powered-By: MyCMS       # custom HTTP header

    csp:                          # Content Security Policy
        script-src: [
            nonce                 # for browsers that support CSP2
            self, unsafe-inline   # for browsers that support CSP1
        ]
\--

For security reasons Nette Framework sends HTTP header `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` by default, so that the page can be embedded in iframe only from pages on the same domain. This behavior may be unwanted in certain situations (for example if you are developing a facebook application). You can override this setting by `frames: yes`, `frames: http://allowed-host.com` or `frames: no`.


HTTP Proxies
============

You can define your HTTP proxy, so that HTTP request's remote address and remote host will be correct.

/--neon
	http:
		proxy: 127.0.0.1  # IP address, range, hostname or array of these values
\--


Latte
=====

You can turn on and off XHTML rendering mode and register custom [Latte |latte:] macros. Custom macros may be passed either as a class name or as a service reference. The default called method is `install`, you may change it by appending a double colon and a custom method name.

/--neon
	latte:
		xhtml: yes  # default is no
		macros:
			- App\MyLatteMacros::register  # static method, classname or callable
			- @App\MyLatteMacrosFactory    # service with install method
			- @App\MyLatteMacrosFactory::register # service with register method

	services:
		- App\MyLatteMacrosFactory
\--


Mailing
=======

Default mailer is `SendmailMailer`. By setting `smtp` you activate `SmtpMailer`.

/--neon
	mail:
		smtp: true  # use SmtpMailer instead of SendmailMailer
		# optional settings
		host: ...
		port: ...
		username: ...
		password: ...
		secure: # possible values are ssl, tls or null
		timeout: ...
\--


Session
=======

By default session will expire in a moment when a browser window is closed. Change the expiration time as follows:

/--neon
	session:
		expiration: 14 days
\--

Automatic session start:

/--neon
	session:
		autoStart: true # výchozí hodnota je 'smart'
\--

Default `autoStart: smart` is recommended. It automatically starts the session only if it already exists.

If you're using a shared hosting, it's suitable to use a custom directory for storing files with session relations:

/--neon
	session:
		savePath: "%tempDir%/sessions"
\--

In this case, `%tempDir%` will be replaced by value you set in `$configurator->setTempDirectory()` in `bootstrap.php`.

If you want to extend the validity of a session (or authentication) for subdomains, let's set just another cookie parameters:

/--neon
	session:
		cookieDomain: 'example.com'
\--

You can set all PHP [directives |http://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php] (in camelCase format).


Tracy Debugger
==============

You can configure some [Tracy | tracy:] parameters and set up panels in the Debugger bar.

/--neon
	tracy:
		email: webmaster@example.com  # for sending error logs
		strictMode: true
		editor: ...
		browser: ...

		bar:  # debugger bar panels
			- Nette\Bridges\DITracy\ContainerPanel  # alias of DI container bar
			- IncludePanel
			- XDebugHelper('myIdeKey')
			- MyPanel(@MyService)

		blueScreen:  # blue screen panels
			- DoctrinePanel::renderException
\--


Low-level Modifications
=======================

All these settings affect the contents of the DI container and the system services it creates. All these services can still be changed to a low-level. For instance, we can change class of service `application.application`, which is by default `Nette\Application\Application`:

/--neon
services:
	application.application:
		factory: MyApplication
		alteration: yes
\--

The `alteration` flag is informative and says we only modify an existing service.

We can also add setup:

/--neon
services:
	application.application:
		factory: MyApplication
		alteration: yes
		setup:
			- $onStartup = [@resource::init]
\--


Services
========

The configuration file is place where we add definitions of our own services in section `services`. See the [DI: Services Configuration |di-configuration] chapter for a detailed description.

For example, this is definition of service named `database` which is `PDO` instance:

/--neon
services:
	database: PDO('mysql:host=127.0.0.1;dbname=test', root, password)
\--



More extensions
===============

Using extensions, the configuration file can be enhanced by additional sections through which we can configure additional components or modify the DI container.

/--neon
extensions:
	dibi: Dibi\Bridges\Nette\DibiExtension22

dibi:
	host: localhost
\--

Nette has a several extensions, e.g. [PhpExtension |di-builtin-extensions#phpextension], [DecoratorExtension |di-builtin-extensions#decoratorextension], [InjectExtension |di-builtin-extensions#injectextension], you can learn more about them in [DI: Built-in Container Extensions |di-builtin-extensions].
