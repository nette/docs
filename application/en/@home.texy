Why choose Nette Application?
-----------------------------

Nette has always been a pioneer in web technologies.

**Bidirectional Router:** Nette features an advanced routing system unique in its bidirectionality - it not only translates URLs to application actions but can also generate URLs in reverse. This means:
- You can modify the URL structure of the entire application at any time without needing to modify templates
- URLs are automatically canonicalized, improving SEO
- Routing is defined in one place, not scattered in annotations

**Components and Signals:** The built-in component system inspired by Delphi and React.js is unique among PHP frameworks:
- Enables creating reusable UI elements
- Supports hierarchical component composition
- Offers elegant AJAX request handling using signals
- Rich library of ready-made components on [Componette](https://componette.org)

**AJAX and Snippets:** Nette introduced a revolutionary way of working with AJAX in 2009, long before similar solutions like Hotwire for Ruby on Rails or Symfony UX Turbo:
- Snippets allow updating only parts of the page without needing to write JavaScript
- Automatic integration with the component system
- Smart invalidation of page sections
- Minimal data transfer

**Intuitive [Latte|latte:] Templates:** The most secure templating system for PHP with advanced features:
- Automatic XSS protection with context-sensitive escaping
- Extensible with custom filters, functions, and tags
- Template inheritance and snippets for AJAX
- Excellent PHP 8.x support with type system

**Dependency Injection:** Nette fully utilizes Dependency Injection:
- Automatic dependency passing (autowiring)
- Configuration using clear NEON format
- Support for component factories
