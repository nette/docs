Nette Forms
***********

<div class=perex>

Nette Forms revolutionized the creation of web forms. Suddenly, writing just a few clear lines of code was enough to get a complete form, including rendering, JavaScript and server-side validation, plus top-notch security. We'll show you how to:

- create user-friendly forms
- validate submitted data
- render elements exactly as needed

</div>


Using Nette Forms, you can avoid many routine tasks, such as writing validation logic (both server-side and client-side), and minimize the probability of errors and security vulnerabilities.

You can use forms either as part of a Nette Application (i.e., in presenters) or completely standalone. Since the usage differs slightly in both cases, we have prepared separate guides for you:

<div class="wiki-buttons">
<div> "Forms in Presenters .[wiki-button]":in-presenter </div>
<div> "Forms Standalone .[wiki-button]":standalone </div>
</div>
