Migrating from 3.1 to 3.2
=========================

The minimum required PHP version is 8.1.

The code has been carefully tuned for PHP 8.1. All new typehints for methods and properties have been added. The changes are minor:

- MySQL: a zero date `0000-00-00` is returned as `null`
- MySQL: a decimal without decimal places is returned as int instead of float
- The `time` type is returned as DateTime with the date `1. 1. 0001` instead of the current date
